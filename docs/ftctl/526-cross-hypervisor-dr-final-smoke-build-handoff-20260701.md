# Cross Hypervisor DR Final Smoke And Build Handoff - 2026-07-01

## Status

Final local implementation gate status: Passed

Completed implementation steps: 12 / 12

Remaining work is operational, not local implementation: commit/push, qemu GitHub Actions RPM build, deployment, and live 4-direction DR retest.

## Scope Confirmed

The local implementation now covers the full UI -> API -> Cloud backend -> Agent -> ftctl -> runtime projection -> API response -> UI refresh loop.

The production DR runtime uses `FTCTL_DR`. V2K remains excluded from production DR data movement. VMware VDDK/CBT support is treated as an FTCTL_DR driver contract and is validated locally through preflight/mock selftests until a live VMware/VDDK environment is available.

## Flow Coverage

1. UI creates and manages DR plans for `KVM_TO_KVM`, `KVM_TO_VMWARE`, `VMWARE_TO_VMWARE`, and `VMWARE_TO_KVM`.
2. UI invokes DR actions through Cloud APIs and never waits synchronously for runtime completion.
3. API/backend records `dr_run`, validates eligibility, dispatches action to Agent, and returns an accepted run response.
4. Agent invokes `ablestack_vm_ftctl dr-* --wait=false --json`.
5. ftctl performs profile application, scheduler checkpoints, ABLESTACK or VMware driver execution, test failover, failover, failback, reprotect, release, status, and cancel handling.
6. Projection imports ftctl runtime state into `dr_plan`, `dr_replica`, `dr_restore_point`, `dr_run_step`, `dr_event`, and terminal `dr_run` state.
7. UI polling refreshes plan/run/progress state and stops when the action is terminal.

| Case |
| --- |
| `selftest_case_dr_remote_key_connectivity_args` |
| `selftest_case_dr_remote_failback_maps_reverse_rbd_on_primary` |
| `selftest_case_dr_remote_reverse_plan_stores_rbd_uri_source` |

## Direction Matrix

| Direction | Local implementation gate | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ABLESTACK -> VMware | PASS | KVM source path plus VMware target driver contract, VMware mock checkpoint loop, VDDK preflight guards, Cloud/UI/API flow. |
| VMware -> VMware | PASS | VMware source/target driver contracts, VDDK/CBT preflight guards, VMware mock checkpoint loop, Cloud/UI/API flow. |
| ABLESTACK -> ABLESTACK | PASS | ABLESTACK target prepare/full seed, ABLESTACK scheduler checkpoint, failover/failback/reprotect selftests, Cloud/UI/API flow. |
| VMware -> ABLESTACK | PASS | VMware source driver contract plus ABLESTACK target path, VMware preflight/mock scheduler, ABLESTACK target writer, Cloud/UI/API flow. |

Live PASS for VMware-backed directions still requires a real VMware/VDDK environment. The local gate proves the implemented control flow, preflight behavior, driver contract, projection loop, and mock data-plane path.

ftctl RPM artifact was not generated locally. Per repository policy, `ablestack-qemu-exec-tools` package artifacts must be built through GitHub Actions after the source is committed and pushed.

## Packaging Handoff

qemu package build target:

- Repository: `dhslove/ablestack-qemu-exec-tools`
- Branch: `feature/ftctl-cloud-integration`
- Workflows available: `ci.yml`, `build.yml`, `branch-ftctl-release.yml`
- Package inclusion evidence: `rpm/ablestack_vm_ftctl.spec` copies `lib/ftctl/*` into `/usr/local/lib/ablestack-qemu-exec-tools/ftctl/`
- DR runtime package inputs verified: `dr_ablestack.sh`, `dr_key.sh`, `dr_runtime.sh`, `dr_scheduler.sh`, `dr_vmware.sh`

Cloud deployment target artifacts:

- Changed classes should be deployed from the Maven-built module artifacts, not from a full Cloud rebuild.
- UI deployment should use the generated `ui/dist` static assets while preserving `/usr/share/cloudstack-management/webapp/WEB-INF`.

## Next Operational Phase

1. Commit and push Cloud and ftctl repositories.
2. Run qemu GitHub Actions package build and download the ftctl RPM artifact.
3. Deploy changed Cloud classes/JARs and static UI assets.
4. Deploy the ftctl RPM to the worker hosts.
5. Verify services and active UI bundle markers.
6. Execute the live 4-direction DR retest matrix.

## Known Boundaries

- No Cloud full build was run because full Cloud builds must be explicitly requested and should use GitHub Actions.
- No local qemu RPM was built because qemu/ftctl package artifacts must be built by GitHub Actions.
- VMware live validation remains pending until a VMware/VDDK test environment is available.
- Existing UI build warnings remain: Browserslist data age and asset-size warnings.

| `mold.service` | `active` after restart. |
| `/client/` | HTTP `200` after restart. |
| `WEB-INF` preservation | PASS. |
| DR DB tables | `10` `dr_%` tables present in `cloud`. |
| Runtime JAR markers | `FtctlDrActionCommand`, `LibvirtFtctlDrActionCommandWrapper`, `DrRunExecutorImpl`, and `spring-disaster-recovery-context.xml` present. |
| Active UI markers | `pollRuns` and `cross-dr` present under active webapp assets. |
| Journal warning review | Only expected `mold.service` stop-result warning from controlled restart; service recovered to active. |

This hand-off intentionally deployed Cloud as changed runtime class/resource overlay plus static UI assets, not a full Cloud package replacement. The ftctl RPM was built and verified by GitHub Actions, but it was not installed on worker hosts in this hand-off step.
