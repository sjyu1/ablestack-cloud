# 207. DR Adopted Replica Re-protection Readiness Design

Date: 2026-05-19

## 1. Purpose

After a remote-Mold DR replica is adopted as the operating VM, or its replica-side protection relationship is force released, that VM becomes a normal production VM on the replica Mold.

The current failure mode is that the replica VM keeps terminal FTCTL details such as `ftctl.dr.recovery.role=adopted`, `ftctl.dr.recovery.released=true`, and `ftctl.last.protection.state=adopted`. `getFtctlProtection` then projects those details as an active protection-like state, so the UI hides the Protection Configuration button even though there is no active `ftctl_protection` row.

This document defines the correction: adoption/release closes the DR recovery session and must leave the VM immediately eligible for new protection registration.

## 2. Related Designs

This document extends:

- [206. DR Replica-Site Disaster Failback And Adoption Design](206-dr-replica-site-disaster-failback-and-adoption-design-20260517.md)
- qemu companion document `209-dr-adopted-replica-reprotect-readiness-design-20260519.md`

It supersedes any wording that implies an adopted replica should keep `ftctl.last.*` VM details as its long-term state record.

## 3. Principles

- Cloud owns Cloud-managed VM, volume, network, storage, host placement, and lifecycle APIs.
- qemu FTCTL owns only data-plane replication, copy/finalize, transport, and qemu runtime cleanup.
- A replica-side adoption or non-destructive release must preserve the VM, volumes, NICs, account ownership, service offering, and Cloud lifecycle state.
- Adoption/release is terminal for the old DR relationship, not an active protection state.
- Audit belongs in Cloud events and action responses. Protection-blocking VM details must not be retained merely as audit history.
- HA and source-controller DR behavior must not regress.

## 4. Backend State Transition

When `adoptFtctlDrReplica` or `releaseFtctlDrReplicaProtection` succeeds:

1. Validate that the requested VM is a remote DR replica recovery target.
2. Optionally ask qemu FTCTL to clean session-specific transport state.
3. Preserve the VM and volumes.
4. Remove all `ftctl.*` VM details from the adopted/released replica VM.
5. Return an action response with terminal values such as:

```text
protectionState=disabled
transportState=stopped
activeSide=primary
adminState=inactive
fencingState=clear
```

6. Publish a Cloud event recording the adoption/release decision.

After step 4, a refreshed `getFtctlProtection` response for the VM must contain only VM identity/basic state unless a new active protection has been registered.

## 5. Defensive Compatibility

Older deployments may already have adopted/released VMs with stale terminal details.

`getFtctlProtection` must therefore treat this detail combination as unconfigured when no active protection row exists:

```text
ftctl.dr.recovery.released=true
ftctl.dr.recovery.role=adopted|released
```

The response must not project stale `ftctl.last.*` values into `protectionState`, `transportState`, `activeSide`, `adminState`, or `fencingState`.

`registerFtctlProtection` must also clear this closed recovery session before writing a new protection configuration, so a stale UI cache cannot block backend registration.

## 6. UI Contract

The FTCTL tab must treat a terminal adopted/released/disabled projection with no `enabled`, `mode`, or `backendMode` as unconfigured.

Expected UI result:

- running adopted replica VM: Protection Configuration button is visible.
- stopped adopted replica VM: Protection Configuration button remains blocked by the existing VM-running rule.
- active standby replica before adoption: replica recovery action view remains visible.
- active source-controller protection: normal protection state and action buttons remain visible.

## 7. Verification

Verify the following from the replica Mold after adoption/release:

- active `ftctl_protection` rows for the VM: `0`.
- `vm_instance_details` rows with `name LIKE 'ftctl.%'` for the VM: `0`.
- `getFtctlProtection` returns VM identity/basic state and no active protection state fields.
- the FTCTL tab shows Protection Configuration when the adopted VM is Running.
- registering new protection on the adopted VM creates a new protection record and new details from the new registration only.
