# Cross Hypervisor DR Serving Process And Disk Map Contract Design - 2026-07-07

## 1. Purpose

This document closes the remaining structural gap found during the VMware to
ABLESTACK DR sync validation for plan `cf377f76-e539-47b5-8dfd-dcaf2b3aaf78`.

The earlier terminal projection design ensures that a host runtime failure can be
projected into Cloud DB and UI state. The latest validation found two additional
contracts that must be explicit:

1. The Cloud API/UI must be served by the currently deployed management process.
   If an old Java process still owns port `8080`, new projection code is present
   on disk but not active at runtime.
2. A VMware source disk map and an ABLESTACK target disk map are different
   artifacts. The runtime must not let the VMware `vmware-disks.json` overwrite
   or represent the ABLESTACK target-preparation contract.

Without these contracts, UI/API can continue to show `SYNCING`/`ACCEPTED` while
FTCTL already reports `ERROR`, and an ABLESTACK target worker can fail before
creating the target VM or target volume.

## 2. Observed Failure

Current validation state:

| Item | Observed value |
| --- | --- |
| Plan UUID | `cf377f76-e539-47b5-8dfd-dcaf2b3aaf78` |
| Latest run UUID | `e8a5647d-3b37-4b51-83d8-22df1ad0f7e4` |
| DB plan state | `SYNCING` |
| DB run state | `ACCEPTED` |
| DB replica state | `SKELETON_READY` |
| FTCTL runtime state | `ERROR` |
| FTCTL runtime step | `ablestack-target-prepare-failed` |
| FTCTL runtime error | `DR_TARGET_DISK_TYPE_INVALID` |
| Target VM | not present |
| Target volume/RBD image | not present |
| Restore point | not present |

Additional runtime evidence:

- The deployed Cloud JAR contained the new projection response fields.
- The active `mold.service` process was not the same process that owned
  listener port `8080`.
- The API endpoint therefore served stale code and did not expose the new
  runtime/effective projection fields.
- The FTCTL state pointed to `disk_map_path=.../vmware-disks.json` while the
  ABLESTACK target contract was available in `ablestack-disks.json`.
- `vmware-disks.json` contained source VMDK references such as `2000` and no
  ABLESTACK target storage/type contract.
- `ablestack-disks.json` contained ABLESTACK target storage data but still
  needed strict target size/type validation before the worker starts.

## 2.1 2026-07-07 Additional Failure: VMware Source Size Missing

A later validation for plan `05527cbe-974e-4ca8-b65e-f844cb3420e7` found the
same source/target disk-map split working as intended, but the input contract
was still not strong enough:

| Item | Observed value |
| --- | --- |
| Run UUID | `79f4a7b9-778b-4279-a4bd-3aa7af38ed53` |
| Cloud plan/run state | `SYNCING` / `ACCEPTED` |
| FTCTL state | `ERROR` |
| FTCTL step | `ablestack-target-map-invalid` |
| FTCTL error | `DR_TARGET_DISK_SIZE_UNRESOLVED` |
| `vmware-disks.json` | disk `2000`, `sizeBytes=0` |
| `ablestack-disks.json` | disk `2000`, `sizeBytes=0`, target `RBD` |
| Target VM/volume | not created |
| Restore point | not created |

This expands the contract:

- VMware source disk size must be resolved during inventory/preview before
  `createDrPlan(startsync=true)` can dispatch.
- Cloud must not persist an executable replica disk as `SKELETON_READY` when
  its `size_bytes` is null or zero.
- RBD target storage must be normalized to the ABLESTACK target contract
  (`targetType=rbd`, canonical raw block target semantics) before FTCTL worker
  materialization.
- FTCTL remains the final guard, but Cloud should fail fast with a clear
  `SOURCE_DISK_SIZE_UNRESOLVED` or `DR_TARGET_DISK_SIZE_UNRESOLVED` message.

The complete layered design for this follow-up is documented in
`538-cross-hypervisor-dr-vmware-to-kvm-disk-size-and-projection-hardening-design-20260707.md`.

## 2.2 2026-07-07 Additional Failure: Empty Disk Row Field Shift

Validation for plan `8a8ccdf4-ab2b-4819-aa5f-9c476cd8b8a5` found a lower-level
FTCTL target-map serialization bug after the source/target disk-map split and
source-size propagation were corrected.

The generated `ablestack-disks.json` was correct:

- `targetStorageType=RBD`
- `targetType=rbd`
- `targetFormat=raw`
- `targetPath=/dev/rbd/Rokcy10-1-dr-disk-0`
- `sizeBytes=107374182400`

FTCTL still failed with `DR_TARGET_DISK_TYPE_INVALID` and event reason
`missing_target_type`. Code inspection showed that `dr_ablestack.sh` converts
disk objects into tab-separated rows and then reads them with Bash `read` using
tab as `IFS`. Because tab is treated as IFS whitespace, empty nullable fields
such as `sourceFormat=""` can be collapsed and later columns can shift, making
the final `targetType` appear empty.

The structural fix is to stop using whitespace-delimited rows for nullable disk
fields. The ABLESTACK target-preparation path must use JSON Lines or another
field-preserving structured format. Cloud projection must also continue to
import terminal runtime state from the host so DB/API/UI do not remain
`SYNCING`/`ACCEPTED` after FTCTL has already reached `ERROR`.

The complete layered design for this follow-up is documented in
`541-cross-hypervisor-dr-ftctl-disk-row-terminal-projection-design-20260707.md`.

## 3. Design Goals

- A UI refresh must not hide a terminal FTCTL runtime error.
- API state must be projected from the actual host runtime for the latest run.
- Cloud deployment validation must fail if the current service process is not
  the process serving `:8080`.
- Source disk metadata and target disk materialization metadata must be separate
  first-class contracts.
- ABLESTACK target preparation must fail before worker acceptance when required
  target disk type, target storage, target size, target network, or target
  offering data is missing.
- Next-step PASS requires target VM/materialization evidence, not only an
  accepted sync run.

## 4. Layered Design

### 4.1 UI Layer

Files:

- `ui/src/views/infra/dr/DrPlanList.vue`
- `ui/src/views/infra/dr/DrPlanOverview.vue`
- `ui/src/utils/dr/resourceActions.js`
- `ui/src/api/dr.js`
- `ui/public/locales/en.json`
- `ui/public/locales/ko_KR.json`

Required behavior:

1. DR plan list/detail must render the effective state returned by the API, not
   only the stored plan state.
2. If `runtimeprojectionstate`, `runtimestate`, `runtimeerrorcode`, or
   `runtimeerrormessage` is present, the detail view must show it in the main
   status panel and latest run panel.
3. If the API marks projection as stale or unavailable, the UI must show a
   warning status and disable failover/test/failback actions.
4. `SYNCING` is only an in-progress display state when the latest run has one of
   these proofs:
   - `runtimeprojectionstate=syncing|target-materializing`
   - worker state `STARTING|RUNNING|RETRYING`
   - target materialization evidence is progressing
5. Action gating must treat these cases as not ready:
   - latest run state `ACCEPTED` with no runtime worker heartbeat
   - runtime state `ERROR|FAILED`
   - `target_vm_present=false`
   - no target disk refs
   - no restore point

Code-level update:

```js
function normalizeDrPlanState(plan) {
  const effective = upper(plan.effectivestate || plan.effectiveState || plan.state)
  const runtime = upper(plan.runtimestate || plan.runtimeState)
  const runtimeError = plan.runtimeerrorcode || plan.runtimeErrorCode
  if (runtime === 'ERROR' || runtime === 'FAILED' || runtimeError) return 'ERROR'
  return effective || upper(plan.state)
}

function isDrPlanNextStepReady(plan) {
  return normalizeDrPlanState(plan) === 'READY'
    && bool(plan.targetvmpresent || plan.targetVmPresent)
    && bool(plan.restorepointpresent || plan.restorePointPresent)
    && !plan.runtimeerrorcode
}
```

The UI must not infer readiness from `state=SYNCING` or `run.state=ACCEPTED`.

### 4.2 API Layer

Files:

- `GetDrPlanCmd.java`
- `ListDrPlansCmd.java`
- `GetDrRunCmd.java`
- `ListDrRunsCmd.java`
- `ListDrRunStepsCmd.java`
- `ListDrReplicasCmd.java`
- `ListDrRestorePointsCmd.java`
- `DrPlanResponse.java`
- `DrRunResponse.java`
- `DrResponseGenerator.java`

Required behavior:

1. All read APIs that are used by DR list/detail/progress views must call
   `DrProjectionService.refreshPlanProjection(planId, true)` before response
   generation.
2. Projection refresh must be best-effort for read APIs, but stale projection
   must be visible in the response instead of silently returning optimistic DB
   state.
3. Plan and run responses must include:
   - `effectiveState`
   - `runtimeProjectionState`
   - `runtimeProjectionChecked`
   - `runtimeState`
   - `runtimeStep`
   - `runtimeErrorCode`
   - `runtimeErrorMessage`
   - `workerState`
   - `workerExitCode`
   - `targetVmPresent`
   - `targetStoragePresent`
   - `targetNetworkPresent`
   - `restorePointPresent`
   - `sourceDiskMapPath`
   - `targetDiskMapPath`
4. If the backend detects a serving-process mismatch, API response must expose
   a warning such as:

```json
{
  "runtimeProjectionState": "STALE",
  "runtimeErrorCode": "DR_MANAGEMENT_SERVING_PROCESS_STALE",
  "runtimeErrorMessage": "Cloud service MainPID is not the process serving port 8080"
}
```

This response field is for operator visibility. Deployment scripts must still
fail hard before this state reaches production use.

### 4.3 Backend Layer

Files:

- `DrProjectionService.java`
- `DrProjectionServiceImpl.java`
- `FtctlDrRuntimeProjectionAdapter.java`
- `DrRunExecutorImpl.java`
- `DrConstants.java`
- `DrEventVO.java`
- `DrRunVO.java`

Required behavior:

1. `DrProjectionServiceImpl.refreshPlanProjection` must classify projection
   results into four categories:

| Category | Meaning | DB effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fresh-success` | Host runtime read and projected | update plan/run/replica/disk |
| `fresh-terminal` | Host runtime terminal error read | fail plan/run/replica/disk atomically |
| `fresh-pending` | Host runtime read but still working | keep in-progress with latest heartbeat |
| `stale` | Status could not be trusted | keep last state but expose projection stale |

2. `FtctlDrRuntimeProjectionAdapter` must not complete a sync run unless
   `isSyncTargetReady` proves all readiness data:
   - runtime state `READY|TARGET_READY`
   - target reference exists in DB or runtime
   - target VM present
   - target storage present
   - target network present
   - restore point present
   - last target durable timestamp exists
3. `failRunFromProjection` must include disk-map diagnostics in
   `dr_run.last_status_json` and `dr_run_step.details_json`.
4. Add explicit constants:
   - `DR_MANAGEMENT_SERVING_PROCESS_STALE`
   - `DR_TARGET_DISK_MAP_INVALID`
   - `DR_TARGET_DISK_SIZE_UNRESOLVED`
   - `DR_TARGET_DISK_TYPE_INVALID`
   - `DR_TARGET_STORAGE_UNRESOLVED`
5. Add a scheduled reconciler for active DR plans:
   - interval: 15-30 seconds
   - candidates: plans in `SYNCING`, `TESTING`, `FAILED_OVER`, `FAILING_BACK`,
     or latest run in `ACCEPTED|RUNNING`
   - action: call `refreshPlanProjection(planId, true)`
   - do not block UI/API calls

Recommended implementation shape:

```java
public interface DrProjectionService {
    DrPlanVO refreshPlanProjection(long planId, boolean bestEffort);
    DrPlanVO markProjectionStale(long planId, String errorCode, String message, String detailsJson);
    int reconcileActivePlans();
}
```

`markProjectionStale` must not overwrite a known terminal runtime error with an
optimistic in-progress state.

### 4.4 Agent Layer

Files:

- `FtctlDrActionCommand.java`
- `FtctlDrStatusCommand.java`
- `FtctlDrStatusAnswer.java`
- `LibvirtFtctlDrActionCommandWrapper.java`
- `LibvirtFtctlDrStatusCommandWrapper.java`
- `LibvirtFtctlDrCommandHelper.java`

Required behavior:

1. Action command payload must carry a complete profile with separate source and
   target disk metadata. The agent writes it once as `profile.json`; FTCTL
   derives source/target maps from that profile.
2. Status command must always pass the run UUID when available:

```bash
ablestack_vm_ftctl dr-status --plan <planUuid> --run <runUuid> --json
```

3. Status answer must parse and expose the new disk map fields:
   - `source_disk_map_path`
   - `target_disk_map_path`
   - `disk_map_role`
   - `target_disk_count`
   - `target_disk_invalid_count`
4. Agent logs must redact credentials and must not print Mold/vCenter secret
   values from the DR site profile.
5. The status wrapper timeout remains bounded and read-only. It must not obtain
   FTCTL global locks or start workers.

Code-level update:

```java
answer.setSourceDiskMapPath(getString(payload, "source_disk_map_path"));
answer.setTargetDiskMapPath(getString(payload, "target_disk_map_path"));
answer.setDiskMapRole(getString(payload, "disk_map_role"));
answer.setTargetDiskCount(getInteger(payload, "target_disk_count"));
answer.setTargetDiskInvalidCount(getInteger(payload, "target_disk_invalid_count"));
```

### 4.5 FTCTL Layer

Files:

- `bin/ablestack_vm_ftctl.sh`
- `lib/ftctl/dr_runtime.sh`
- `lib/ftctl/dr_vmware.sh`
- `lib/ftctl/dr_ablestack.sh`
- `bin/ablestack_vm_ftctl_selftest.sh`

Required runtime model:

| Artifact | Owner | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `profile.json` | Cloud/Agent | Full DR plan contract |
| `vmware-disks.json` | VMware source driver | Source VMDK/CBT/checkpoint metadata |
| `ablestack-disks.json` | ABLESTACK target driver | Target storage/materialization contract |
| `status.state` | FTCTL runtime | latest visible runtime state |
| `runs/<run>.state` | FTCTL runtime | run-specific runtime state |

The state file must no longer use a single ambiguous `disk_map_path` as the only
disk-map field. It must persist:

```text
source_disk_map_path=/run/.../vmware-disks.json
target_disk_map_path=/run/.../ablestack-disks.json
disk_map_role=target
disk_map_path=/run/.../ablestack-disks.json
```

`disk_map_path` may remain for backward compatibility, but for target-provider
ABLESTACK it must point to `target_disk_map_path`.

Required FTCTL function changes:

1. Add helpers in `dr_runtime.sh`:

```bash
ftctl_dr_runtime_source_disk_map_path() {
  printf '%s/vmware-disks.json\n' "$(ftctl_dr_runtime_plan_dir "$1")"
}

ftctl_dr_runtime_target_disk_map_path() {
  local plan="$1" target_provider="$2"
  case "$(printf '%s' "$target_provider" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')" in
    ABLESTACK) printf '%s/ablestack-disks.json\n' "$(ftctl_dr_runtime_plan_dir "$plan")" ;;
    VMWARE*) printf '%s/vmware-target-disks.json\n' "$(ftctl_dr_runtime_plan_dir "$plan")" ;;
    *) printf '%s/target-disks.json\n' "$(ftctl_dr_runtime_plan_dir "$plan")" ;;
  esac
}

ftctl_dr_runtime_set_disk_maps() {
  local state_path="$1" source_map="$2" target_map="$3" role="$4"
  ftctl_dr_runtime_path_set "$state_path" \
    "source_disk_map_path=$source_map" \
    "target_disk_map_path=$target_map" \
    "disk_map_role=$role" \
    "disk_map_path=$target_map"
}
```

2. Update `ftctl_dr_vmware_sync_start`:
   - write only source map/checkpoint fields for VMware source mode
   - set `source_disk_map_path`
   - never overwrite target `disk_map_path` for target-provider ABLESTACK

3. Update `ftctl_dr_ablestack_sync_start`:
   - always canonicalize `profile.json` into `ablestack-disks.json`
   - set `target_disk_map_path`
   - set compatibility `disk_map_path` to the ABLESTACK map
   - perform preflight before target preparation

4. Add target disk preflight in `dr_ablestack.sh`:

```bash
ftctl_dr_ablestack_validate_target_disk_map() {
  local disk_map="$1"
  python3 - "$disk_map" <<'PY'
import json, sys
data = json.load(open(sys.argv[1], encoding="utf-8"))
errors = []
for i, disk in enumerate(data.get("disks") or []):
    target_type = str(disk.get("targetType") or "").lower()
    target_storage_type = str(disk.get("targetStorageType") or "").upper()
    size = int(disk.get("sizeBytes") or 0)
    if target_storage_type == "RBD" and target_type != "rbd":
        errors.append(f"DR_TARGET_DISK_TYPE_INVALID:{i}")
    if size <= 0:
        errors.append(f"DR_TARGET_DISK_SIZE_UNRESOLVED:{i}")
    if not (disk.get("targetPath") or disk.get("targetName")):
        errors.append(f"DR_TARGET_DISK_MAP_INVALID:{i}")
if errors:
    print(",".join(errors))
    sys.exit(32)
PY
}
```

5. VMware source sizes must be resolved from VMware/VDDK metadata, not from
   local file stat on a disk key such as `2000`.

Valid size sources, in priority order:

1. Cloud guided inventory `source.disks[].sizeBytes`
2. VMware inventory `capacityInBytes`
3. VDDK/VixDiskLib metadata
4. Explicit operator override from UI target disk size

If all are missing, fail before accepting the run:

```text
state=ERROR
step=dr-preflight-failed
error_code=DR_TARGET_DISK_SIZE_UNRESOLVED
accepted=false
```

6. `dr-status` output must include:

```json
{
  "source_disk_map_path": ".../vmware-disks.json",
  "target_disk_map_path": ".../ablestack-disks.json",
  "disk_map_role": "target",
  "target_disk_count": 1,
  "target_disk_invalid_count": 0
}
```

### 4.6 DB Layer

Existing schema can support the immediate fix through JSON/status columns, but
the following persistence rules are required:

| Table | Required update |
| --- | --- |
| `dr_plan` | terminal runtime error sets `state=ERROR`, `last_error_code`, `last_error_message` |
| `dr_run` | latest status JSON stores FTCTL runtime with source/target disk map paths |
| `dr_run_step` | add/update `runtime-projection` step for every projection refresh |
| `dr_replica` | sync is not ready until target VM/external ref is present |
| `dr_replica_disk` | details JSON stores target disk type/storage/size/map path |
| `dr_restore_point` | created only after durable target checkpoint exists |

Optional schema hardening:

```sql
ALTER TABLE dr_run
  ADD COLUMN runtime_state varchar(32) NULL,
  ADD COLUMN runtime_error_code varchar(255) NULL,
  ADD COLUMN runtime_updated datetime NULL,
  ADD COLUMN source_disk_map_path varchar(1024) NULL,
  ADD COLUMN target_disk_map_path varchar(1024) NULL;
```

This optional migration is not required for the immediate fix if the existing
JSON response path is used consistently.

## 5. Serving Process Contract

The deployment process must verify that the process serving the active Cloud UI
and API is the process started by `mold.service`.

Required validation after Cloud class/JAR deployment:

```bash
service_pid="$(systemctl show -p MainPID --value mold.service)"
listener_pid="$(ss -ltnp 'sport = :8080' | sed -n 's/.*pid=\([0-9]\+\).*/\1/p' | head -n1)"
test -n "$service_pid" && test "$service_pid" = "$listener_pid"
pgrep -af 'org.apache.cloudstack.ServerDaemon' | wc -l
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/client/ >/dev/null
```

If `service_pid != listener_pid`, deployment must fail and the stale process
must be stopped before any DR retest. A successful class copy alone is not a
valid deployment.

Expected deployment guard result:

| Check | PASS condition |
| --- | --- |
| `mold.service` active | `systemctl is-active mold.service` returns `active` |
| Listener ownership | `MainPID == ss(:8080).pid` |
| Duplicate ServerDaemon | no extra active old process owns `8080` |
| API marker | `getDrPlan` response contains latest runtime/effective fields |
| UI marker | active bundle contains DR progress/projection markers |

## 6. End-to-End Readiness Rule

A VMware to ABLESTACK DR plan is PASS for the next step only when all layers
agree:

| Layer | PASS evidence |
| --- | --- |
| UI | effective state `READY`, no runtime error banner |
| API | plan `effectiveState=READY`, latest run `SUCCEEDED` |
| Backend | latest projection check is fresh and not stale |
| Agent | run-aware `dr-status` returned successfully |
| FTCTL | runtime `READY`, `target_vm_present=true`, `restore_point_present=true` |
| DB | target replica, target disk refs, and restore point rows exist |
| Target platform | target VM/materialized volume exists in ABLESTACK or VMware |

The following states are always FAIL for next-step readiness:

- plan `SYNCING` with run `ACCEPTED` and no worker heartbeat
- runtime `ERROR|FAILED`
- `target_vm_present=false`
- no target disk refs
- no restore point
- serving process mismatch

## 7. Implementation Result - 2026-07-07

The implementation follows this contract with the following concrete updates:

- FTCTL now exports `source_disk_map_path`, `target_disk_map_path`,
  `disk_map_role`, `target_disk_count`, and `target_disk_invalid_count` in
  runtime status JSON.
- Cloud agent status answer and the KVM status wrapper parse those fields and
  return them to management.
- Backend projection stores the fields in the existing runtime/details JSON and
  blocks target readiness when runtime explicitly reports
  `target_vm_present=false`, `target_storage_present=false`,
  `target_network_present=false`, or `restore_point_present=false`.
- Plan/run API responses expose the disk-map diagnostics so UI can render the
  same evidence used by the backend readiness decision.
- UI action gating no longer enables test failover or failover from a stored
  `READY`/`SYNCING` label alone. It requires target materialization evidence
  and no runtime failure.
- No new DB table or column is required. The compatibility layer uses the
  existing plan/run detail JSON so this can be deployed as changed Java classes,
  changed resources, and UI static assets.

## 8. Implementation Order

1. Fix deployment/runtime validation so stale Cloud management processes cannot
   serve API/UI after class deployment.
2. Extend FTCTL state fields with source/target disk map paths and target disk
   map role.
3. Make ABLESTACK target map authoritative for ABLESTACK target preparation.
4. Add VMware disk size propagation and fail-fast target disk map preflight.
5. Extend agent status answer with source/target disk map fields.
6. Extend backend projection to persist and expose map diagnostics.
7. Add scheduled active-plan projection reconciliation.
8. Update UI state rendering/action gating to require effective ready evidence.
9. Add regression tests for stale process detection, map selection, target size
   failure, and terminal projection.

## 9. Test Matrix

| Test | Expected result |
| --- | --- |
| Old Java process owns `8080` after deployment | deployment validation fails |
| FTCTL `ERROR` while DB run is `ACCEPTED` | API projects plan/run to failure |
| VMware source disk id `2000` without size | preflight fails with `DR_TARGET_DISK_SIZE_UNRESOLVED` |
| RBD target storage with non-rbd target type | preflight fails with `DR_TARGET_DISK_TYPE_INVALID` |
| Valid VMware to ABLESTACK plan | target map path is `ablestack-disks.json` |
| Target materialization incomplete | plan remains not ready and actions are disabled |
| Target VM/volume/restore point present | plan becomes `READY`, latest run `SUCCEEDED` |
