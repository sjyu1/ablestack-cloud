# Cross Hypervisor DR Failback Modal Dark Mode Implementation Result

## 1. Scope

This change improves the failback dialog defined by the site-derived failback
contract. It changes presentation only and does not change failback execution,
API parameters, asynchronous job handling, agent dispatch, FTCTL commands, or
database records.

## 2. Root Cause

The dialog used the default Ant Design bordered description table without a
dark-mode override. The global dark theme changed the label text to a light
color but left the label cell background at `#fafafa`, producing insufficient
contrast. Site identity, connection state, and credential state were also
concatenated as one text string, which reduced readability and made wrapping
unpredictable.

## 3. Implementation

### UI

- `DrPlanList.vue`
  - Applies a dedicated success/error alert class.
  - Renders current and destination sites as structured identity and status
    fields instead of slash-separated text.
  - Uses `DrStatusPill` for connection and credential states.
  - Renders the durable checkpoint as a structured value.
- `DrStatusPill.vue`
  - Treats `CONFIGURED` as a success state.
- `cross-dr.less`
  - Defines light/dark success and error tokens shared by DR modals.
  - Defines stable bordered-description label/content dimensions and wrapping.
  - Adds explicit dark-mode label and content surfaces with sufficient selector
    priority to override Ant Design defaults.
  - Keeps the dialog within the viewport and stacks site details on narrow
    screens.

### Unchanged Layers

| Layer | Result |
|---|---|
| API | No request or response contract change |
| Backend | No action, eligibility, or orchestration change |
| Agent | No command or status-reporting change |
| FTCTL | No engine or runtime-profile change |
| DB | No schema, migration, or data change |

## 4. AS-IS / TO-BE

| Area | AS-IS | TO-BE |
|---|---|---|
| Ready alert | Theme-dependent low contrast | Dark success surface and readable success text |
| Site information | Name, type, and state concatenated with separators | Structured identity plus status pills |
| Description label | Light `#fafafa` cell with light text in dark mode | Opaque dark label cell with secondary light text |
| Description content | Theme-dependent background | Stable dark content surface and primary light text |
| Long values | Unstable wrapping | Fixed table layout and `overflow-wrap` |
| Mobile layout | Horizontal site metadata could compress | Site identity and states stack vertically |

## 5. Build And Deployment

- Build workspace:
  `/home/ablecloud/work/dhslove/ablestack-cloud-failback-build-20260725/ui`
- Build command:
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider npm run build`
- Artifact:
  `/home/ablecloud/work/artifacts/dr-failback-darkmode-20260726/cloud-dr-failback-darkmode-ui-dist-v2.tgz`
- SHA256:
  `e5432b0262e330cac350eab23d3e154692e9c0c6c132c7662125a6ccf4ce37d9`
- Deployment target:
  `/usr/share/cloudstack-management/webapp`
- Deployment backup:
  `/root/dr-failback-darkmode-ui-deploy-20260726-011534`

Only static UI files were overlaid. `WEB-INF` was preserved and `/client/`
returned HTTP 200 before and after deployment.

## 6. Live Verification

Verified with the failback dialog for DR plan
`2514a846-64a2-4bc7-ba88-38a874410782` without submitting the action.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Ready alert | `rgba(82, 196, 26, 0.12)` background, readable success text |
| Label cell | `rgb(36, 44, 51)` background |
| Content cell | `rgb(32, 39, 45)` background |
| Label/content border | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12)` |
| Modal geometry | 600 x 648 within 1429 x 881 viewport |
| Page horizontal overflow | None |
| Browser console errors | None |
| Current/destination site states | `CONNECTED`, `CONFIGURED` rendered as success pills |

## 7. Retest Readiness

PASS. The failback dialog is ready for functional retesting. This verification
did not submit failback, so runtime state and DR data were not changed.
