# FT XCOLO KRBD Hook Guard Consumer Deployment Design - 2026-06-27

## Purpose

FTCTL now creates a KRBD guard under `/run/ablestack-vm-ftctl/krbd-guard/<vm>`
during FT XCOLO cold conversion. The guard is incomplete unless cloud agent
scripts consume it before unmapping KRBD devices.

This document records the confirmed cloud source files, build/install paths,
current host runtime paths, and the deployment verification required for the
hook-side guard consumer change.

## Confirmed Files And Paths

| Area | Source | Transformed/build file | Package install path | Active runtime path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| libvirt qemu hook | `agent/bindir/libvirtqemuhook.in` | `agent/target/transformed/libvirtqemuhook` | `/usr/share/cloudstack-agent/lib/libvirtqemuhook` | `/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu` |
| RBD cleanup script | `agent/bindir/cleanup-rbd.in` | `agent/target/transformed/cleanup-rbd` | `/usr/bin/cleanup-rbd` | Current 32.x hosts override to `/usr/local/sbin/cleanup_rbd.sh` |
| cleanup-rbd unit | `packaging/systemd/cleanup-rbd.service` | package unit | `/usr/lib/systemd/system/cleanup-rbd.service` | Current 32.x hosts shadow it with `/etc/systemd/system/cleanup-rbd.service` |
| cleanup-rbd timer | `packaging/systemd/cleanup-rbd.timer` | package unit | `/usr/lib/systemd/system/cleanup-rbd.timer` | `cleanup-rbd.timer` enabled and active |

The EL9 spec installs the hook library and then copies it to the libvirt hook
runtime path in `%posttrans agent`:

```text
install -D agent/target/transformed/libvirtqemuhook ... /usr/share/cloudstack-agent/lib/libvirtqemuhook
cp -a .../libvirtqemuhook /etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu
systemctl restart libvirtd
```

Therefore `/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu` is not package-owned on the checked hosts,
but agent package reinstall should refresh it through `%posttrans`.

## Current 32.x Host Verification

Checked hosts:

```text
10.10.32.1
10.10.32.2
10.10.32.3
```

Confirmed:

- `/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu` exists and is executable.
- `/usr/bin/cleanup-rbd` exists and is owned by `cloudstack-agent`.
- `/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu` is not package-owned.
- `cleanup-rbd.timer` is enabled and active.
- Active service is `/etc/systemd/system/cleanup-rbd.service`.
- Active service runs `/usr/local/sbin/cleanup_rbd.sh`, not `/usr/bin/cleanup-rbd`.

This means future deployment must verify both the package-installed script and
the active override script.

## Required Code Design

### `libvirtqemuhook.in`

Add guard consumer logic to `unmapStorage()`.

Guard is active when:

1. `/run/ablestack-vm-ftctl/krbd-guard/<domain>/enabled` exists.
2. `expires` exists and is greater than current epoch time.
3. The RBD path being unmapped matches one entry from `paths`.

Path matching must support:

- `/dev/rbd/<pool>/<image>`
- `/dev/rbdN`, resolved through `rbd showmapped`
- `<pool>/<image>`
- `<image>`

Expected behavior:

```python
if is_ftctl_krbd_guarded(domain_name, img):
    logger.info("ftctl_krbd_guard_skip_unmap domain=%s path=%s", domain_name, img)
    continue
```

Only skip the guarded `rbd unmap`; do not skip the whole `release/end` hook or
custom hook execution.

Generated FT XCOLO primary XML may carry qemu-commandline disks and therefore
libvirt hook XML can contain disk nodes without a `source dev` value. The hook
must skip that empty source explicitly and log
`ftctl_krbd_skip_empty_unmap_source` instead of attempting `rbd unmap ""`.

The hook keeps `/var/log/libvirt/qemu-hook.log` as the production default. For
local smoke testing, `QEMU_HOOK_LOG` may override that path without changing host
runtime behavior.

### `cleanup-rbd.in`

Add guarded images to the used-image set:

```bash
used_images=($(get_used_images; get_guarded_images | sort -u))
```

The same guard and path normalization rules used by the qemu hook apply here.
Expired or malformed guards must be ignored so stale mappings can be cleaned
later.

### Current Host Override

Because the active unit runs `/usr/local/sbin/cleanup_rbd.sh`, immediate test
deployment must update:

- `/usr/bin/cleanup-rbd`
- `/usr/local/sbin/cleanup_rbd.sh`

The package unit can remain unchanged during the test. Removing the local
override and returning to `/usr/bin/cleanup-rbd` should be handled as a separate
operations change.

## Deployment Checklist

After package or hotfix deployment, verify on every compute host:

```bash
cmp -s /usr/share/cloudstack-agent/lib/libvirtqemuhook /etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu
grep -n "ftctl_krbd_guard_skip_unmap" /etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu
grep -n "ftctl_krbd_skip_empty_unmap_source" /etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu
grep -n "get_guarded_images" /usr/bin/cleanup-rbd
grep -n "get_guarded_images" /usr/local/sbin/cleanup_rbd.sh
systemctl is-enabled cleanup-rbd.timer
systemctl is-active cleanup-rbd.timer
systemctl cat cleanup-rbd.service
```

Expected:

- Runtime hook matches the cloudstack-agent library hook.
- Runtime hook contains FTCTL guard logic.
- Packaged cleanup script and active override cleanup script both contain guard
  logic.
- `cleanup-rbd.timer` remains enabled and active.

Before host deployment, also verify Maven transformed artifacts:

```bash
grep -n "ftctl_krbd_guard_skip_unmap" agent/target/transformed/libvirtqemuhook
grep -n "get_guarded_images" agent/target/transformed/cleanup-rbd
python3 -m py_compile agent/target/transformed/libvirtqemuhook
bash -n agent/target/transformed/cleanup-rbd
```

## Runtime Test Evidence

During FT protection retest, collect:

```bash
find /run/ablestack-vm-ftctl/krbd-guard/<vm> -maxdepth 1 -type f -print -exec cat {} \;
tail -n 200 /var/log/libvirt/qemu-hook.log | grep -E "ftctl_krbd_guard|rbd unmap"
systemctl start cleanup-rbd.service
journalctl -u cleanup-rbd.service -n 200 --no-pager
```

Expected:

- qemu hook logs `ftctl_krbd_guard_skip_unmap` while guard is active.
- cleanup-rbd treats guarded mappings as used.
- generated primary does not fail with `/dev/rbd/rbd/<image>: No such file or directory`.

## Build And Deployment Notes

- This is a cloud agent change, not a UI-only or management-only change.
- Full package deployment should deploy the `cloudstack-agent` package to
  compute hosts.
- On the current 32.x cluster, package work must use `aspm`/`aspkg`.
- If doing a manual hotfix, copy the transformed hook to both
  `/usr/share/cloudstack-agent/lib/libvirtqemuhook` and `/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu`.
- If doing a manual hotfix, copy the guarded cleanup script to both
  `/usr/bin/cleanup-rbd` and `/usr/local/sbin/cleanup_rbd.sh`.
- Run `systemctl daemon-reload` and verify `cleanup-rbd.timer` after deployment.

## Success Criteria

- FTCTL guard producer and cloud hook/cleanup consumers use the same guard
  contract.
- libvirt qemu hook does not unmap guarded KRBD paths during XCOLO conversion.
- cleanup-rbd timer does not unmap guarded KRBD paths during XCOLO conversion.
- Guard expiry still permits later cleanup of stale mappings.
- Deployment verification distinguishes source, transformed, package-installed,
  and active runtime files.
