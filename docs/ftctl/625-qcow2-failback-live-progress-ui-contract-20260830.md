# qcow2 failback live progress UI contract

## Problem

The failback action can finish its synchronous Cloud dispatch steps before the
FTCTL data worker finishes copying. The operation row then exposes a backend
workflow value of 100 percent even though the authoritative transfer journal is
still active. A version 1 qcow2 journal is also rejected by the UI version 2
guard, so users see neither bytes nor ETA.

## TO-BE

- FTCTL SharedMountPoint qcow2 workers publish transfer schema version 2 with
  plan, run, and cycle ownership.
- Cloud continues to expose the operation-owned live sample on the Run.
- For non-terminal `SYNC`, `RECOVER_SYNC`, and `FAILBACK` operations, a valid
  live transfer sample prevents a stale 100-percent workflow value from being
  displayed as completion.
- The UI maps the transfer into the 70-95 percent workflow range. Only a
  terminal Run may display completed 100 percent.
- The operation table and expanded progress panel use the same shared progress
  resolver. A non-terminal backend value of 100 is reduced to the current
  lifecycle floor until a valid transfer sample arrives, then follows the
  70-95 transfer range.
- The transfer panel shows bytes, throughput, ETA, disk position, and transfer
  mode using the same sample.
- After a Run becomes terminal, the UI applies the cached protection snapshot
  first and the live Plan action contract last. A stale snapshot must not keep
  `cancelRun` visible or suppress the next valid action.
- Protection View snapshot version 4 and later is authoritative for active-run
  ownership. When `activeRun` is empty, the UI must not promote an older
  non-terminal operation-history row back into the current action contract.
  Live history may only confirm or terminalize the active Run named by the
  snapshot.

## Regression gate

- Unit test an active failback with backend workflow 100 and transfer 11.
- Unit test a dispatching Run with backend workflow 100 and require 15 percent
  in both the table and expanded panel.
- Retain the existing monotonic SYNC progress tests.
- Run FTCTL qcow2 SharedMountPoint smoke tests and Cloud UI unit tests.
- Validate the deployed UI from a real failback before marking the menu PASS.
- Verify that terminal failback removes `cancelRun` and restores the source-side
  actions without a page reload.
- Verify that an old `ACCEPTED` history row cannot revive `cancelRun` when the
  authoritative snapshot has no active Run.
