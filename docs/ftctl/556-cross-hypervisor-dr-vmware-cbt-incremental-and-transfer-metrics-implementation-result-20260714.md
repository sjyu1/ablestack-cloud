# Cross Hypervisor DR VMware CBT Incremental And Transfer Metrics Implementation Result

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Scope: VMware source to ABLESTACK target
- Design: `555-cross-hypervisor-dr-vmware-cbt-incremental-and-transfer-metrics-design-20260714.md`
- Result: implementation, build, deployment, package smoke, and retest cleanup PASS
- Live acceptance: initial seed and repeated durable reseed PASS; measured CBT incremental FAIL as of 2026-07-17

## 1. Implemented Flow

```text
RPO cycle starts
  -> create short-lived VMware snapshot
  -> FULL_SEED: capture current changeId and perform full copy
  -> later cycle: QueryChangedDiskAreas(previous changeId)
  -> normalize and validate changed extents
  -> read/write only changed extents through source/target NBD
  -> fsync target
  -> atomically replace local per-disk changeId baseline
  -> remove owned VMware snapshot
  -> publish effective mode and transfer metrics
  -> Agent typed status
  -> Cloud asynchronous projection to dr_restore_point
  -> UI synchronization history
```

The VMware snapshot is not the long-lived baseline. The retained baseline is
the per-disk changeId committed after target durability. Snapshot removal does
not force the next cycle to be a full copy.

## 2. Component Results

| Layer | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| UI | Sequence and timestamps could not prove incrementality | Effective mode, verification, measured/estimated kind, changed/read/written/payload bytes, extents, duration, and throughput |
| API | Restore-point response had no transfer evidence | Existing response exposes typed cycle metrics without a new blocking API |
| Backend | Latest checkpoint projection persisted timestamps only | Runtime projection idempotently updates the matching typed restore-point history row |
| Agent | FTCTL status stopped at checkpoint identifiers | Status answer/wrapper carry latest-completed mode, verification, metrics, generation, and token |
| FTCTL | Every cycle used full `qemu-img convert` | Full seed once; later cycles query VMware CBT and apply changed extents; no silent full fallback |
| DB | `dr_restore_point` contained checkpoint metadata only | Thirteen typed cycle-evidence columns are present on all create/upgrade schema paths |
| Snapshot | Snapshot deletion was incorrectly treated as baseline loss | Short-lived snapshot cleanup is independent from the atomically retained changeId baseline |

## 3. Build Evidence

- Cloud Maven build root: WSL ext4
  `/home/ablecloud/work/build/cbt-20260714-185411/cloud`
- Successful changed-module build:
  `mvn -pl core,plugins/hypervisors/kvm,plugins/integrations/disaster-recovery -DskipTests install`
- Successful focused test:
  `FtctlDrRuntimeProjectionAdapterTest`, 10 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors
- UI production build: completed with only existing asset-size and Browserslist warnings
- FTCTL shell/Python syntax checks: PASS
- FTCTL extent patch test: PASS

## 4. FTCTL Package Evidence

- Source branch: `feature/ftctl-cloud-integration`
- Source commit: `54b88b8dc8f21573d9f5bbc126de11646292e632`
- GitHub Actions run:
  `https://github.com/dhslove/ablestack-qemu-exec-tools/actions/runs/29325295248`
- RPM: `ablestack_vm_ftctl-0.9.1-1.noarch.rpm`
- RPM SHA-256:
  `259ef219c7c46bbbd022426097e20cd33211debb9cd25c54b144dd2db17ab86f`

The RPM and changed Agent classes were deployed to `10.10.32.1`, `.2`, and
`.3`. Installed markers for CBT query, extent patch, effective mode, and
transfer metrics were verified on all hosts.

## 5. Cloud And DB Deployment Evidence

- Cloud was deployed by replacing only six changed class entries in the active
  management JAR.
- Agent deployment replaced only the changed core status-answer class and KVM
  status-wrapper class.
- Deployed class entry SHA-256 values match the WSL Maven output on management
  and all three Agent hosts.
- UI deployment preserved
  `/usr/share/cloudstack-management/webapp/WEB-INF` and updated static assets
  only.
- `/client/` returned HTTP 200 and active bundle/locale markers were present.
- DB backup was created before migration.
- Added `dr_restore_point` columns:
  `effective_mode`, `incremental_verified`, `metrics_estimated`,
  `virtual_bytes`, `changed_bytes`, `source_read_bytes`,
  `target_written_bytes`, `transfer_payload_bytes`, `changed_extent_count`,
  `duration_ms`, `throughput_bps`, `baseline_generation`, and `cycle_token`.

## 6. Service And Package Smoke

- `mold.service`: active
- `mold-agent.service`: active on all three hosts
- `ablestack-vm-ftctl.timer`: active on all three hosts
- Cloud hosts `1`, `2`, and `3`: `Up / Enabled`
- Recent management/Agent fatal class or schema error count: 0
- Installed extent-patch smoke: two extents, 192 bytes; source-read, target-write,
  and payload counters all matched 192 bytes; target content comparison PASS
- vCenter source VM snapshot tree had no remaining FTCTL-owned snapshot

## 7. Retest Cleanup

- Previous Plan `410be8ad-1b40-4405-bcd5-b0840fa7caba`:
  Release Run succeeded, then `deleteDrPlan` succeeded.
- Active Plan count: 0
- Previous target VM `245`: expunging and removed
- Previous target volume `471`: expunged and removed
- FTCTL Plan runtime directory removed after process/lock verification
- FTCTL global lock clear; no attached NBD device remained

## 8. Acceptance Boundary

Build, deployment, schema, service, and installed package smoke are PASS. The
next live test must prove the end-to-end data path:

1. Create a new Plan and complete sequence 1 as `FULL_SEED`.
2. Make a small known write in the VMware guest.
3. Wait for sequence 2.
4. Confirm `effectiveMode=CBT_INCREMENTAL`,
   `incrementalVerified=true`, and `metricsEstimated=false`.
5. Confirm changed/read/written bytes are materially smaller than virtual disk
   bytes and the target content is correct.
6. Confirm the FTCTL-owned snapshot count returns to zero after completion.

Until sequence 2 passes these checks, build/package evidence remains valid but
runtime deployment readiness is FAIL.

## 9. Live Acceptance Failure And Corrective Handoff

Plan `538befc6-0efb-4304-ba1a-5243311de4fb` proved source CBT query and full
target copy, but the newly added per-disk result jq expression failed on the
reserved `$label` keyword. The target RBD retained valid partition/filesystem
signatures, while no restore point, target VM, or committed changeId existed.

`listDrPlans` and `getDrPlan` also became invalid JSON because the Backend used
the complete FTCTL status payload as `last_error_message`, exposing nested
Unicode escapes through the generic API serializer.

Corrective implementation, recovery states, typed error transport, UI
last-good-data behavior, and retest gates are defined in:

- [557-cross-hypervisor-dr-cycle-commit-and-api-json-recovery-design-20260716.md](557-cross-hypervisor-dr-cycle-commit-and-api-json-recovery-design-20260716.md)

The corrective implementation was subsequently built and deployed. The failed
Plan was released and soft-deleted, its uncommitted RBD/runtime was removed,
and the environment is ready for a fresh full-seed plus incremental acceptance
run. Deployment evidence and the remaining gate are recorded in section 16 of
the linked document.

## 10. 2026-07-17 Live Incremental Reassessment

New Linux and Windows Plans completed initial seed, target materialization, and
multiple durable cycles. Nevertheless every later cycle was `FULL_RESEED`,
with transferred bytes equal to the complete virtual disk set and
`incrementalVerified=false`.

The committed disk maps are healthy and advance changeId/generation. The
failure occurs when `ftctl_vmware_mover_disk_plan()` omits the committed
baseline state and generation from its execution rows. The mode resolver then
promotes every incremental request to reseed. Cloud has an additional race in
which a completed cycle can remain `TRANSFERRING` if the next cycle starts
before the status poll.

Therefore build/deployment evidence remains valid, but functional continuous
DR acceptance is still FAIL. The next implementation and live gate are defined
in
`559-cross-hypervisor-dr-incremental-mode-decision-and-cycle-projection-design-20260717.md`.
