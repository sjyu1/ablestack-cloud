# Cross-Hypervisor DR Sync Cycle Terminal And Runtime Summary Convergence Design

## 1. Scope

This change completes the lifecycle of older sync-cycle rows after a newer
durable checkpoint has been committed. It also makes the raw
`dr_plan_runtime` transfer summary identify the same completed cycle used by
the list and Protection APIs.

The VDDK, CBT, RBD, snapshot, transfer, Failover, and Failback data paths are
unchanged.

## 2. Problem

After a successful Failback and the following durability cycle, the latest
cycle is complete and usable, but older rows can remain non-terminal:

- a delayed or restarted forward cycle can remain `SYNCING`;
- the reverse Failback checkpoint can remain `FAILBACK_DATA_READY` after it has
  already been consumed by the next forward durable cycle;
- `dr_plan_runtime` can retain transfer bytes and mode from an old live sample.

These rows are ignored by the current read model, but they make operational
history and direct DB inspection ambiguous.

## 3. Terminal Contract

When FTCTL publishes a coherent latest completed cycle `N`, Cloud performs the
following ordered convergence:

1. project cycle `N` into `dr_sync_cycle` and require `completed` to be set;
2. set the raw runtime transfer summary to cycle `N` when replication is
   `IDLE`;
3. query incomplete rows with `sequence < N` in bounded batches;
4. change reverse data-ready rows to `CONSUMED` with commit state
   `CONSUMED_BY_DURABLE_CYCLE`;
5. change other incomplete rows to `SUPERSEDED` with commit state
   `SUPERSEDED_BY_DURABLE_CYCLE`;
6. clear stale cycle error fields and assign the durable completion time.

The query contains `completed IS NULL`, so retries and management-server
restarts are idempotent. A batch limit prevents a status refresh from scanning
an unbounded history.

## 4. Runtime Summary Contract

When `replication_activity=IDLE`, the raw runtime row is overwritten from the
same coherent FTCTL completed-cycle snapshot:

- cycle and sample sequence: latest completed sequence;
- phase: `COMPLETED`;
- mode and bytes: the latest completed cycle metrics;
- percent and ETA: `100` and `0`;
- sampled time: target durable time;
- stale: `false`.

Live operation samples remain authoritative while replication is active. This
keeps the existing progress path unchanged.

## 5. Layer Design

| Layer | Design |
|---|---|
| UI | No component change; existing fields receive one coherent cycle |
| API | Existing response fields remain backward compatible |
| Backend | Runtime projection persists the latest completed summary and then terminalizes older cycles |
| Agent | No protocol change; the existing completed-cycle snapshot is sufficient |
| FTCTL | No data-path change; FTCTL remains the producer of durable-cycle evidence |
| DB | No schema change; existing `state`, `commit_state`, `completed`, and error columns are used |

## 6. Verification

Unit tests cover:

- stale raw `FULL_RESEED` summary converging to completed
  `CBT_INCREMENTAL` cycle 528;
- cycle 523 becoming `SUPERSEDED`;
- reverse cycle 527 becoming `CONSUMED`;
- repeated projection after restart producing no additional terminal writes.

Runtime PASS requires:

- latest runtime, list API, Protection API, and `dr_sync_cycle` use one cycle;
- no lower sequence remains incomplete;
- Failover and Failback runs and sessions remain terminal-success;
- FTCTL reverse evidence and scheduler state remain healthy;
- a new incremental cycle can start after cleanup.

## 7. AS-IS / TO-BE

| Area | AS-IS | TO-BE |
|---|---|---|
| Reverse checkpoint | `FAILBACK_DATA_READY` can remain indefinitely | Next durable cycle marks it `CONSUMED` |
| Interrupted older cycle | Lower sequence can remain `SYNCING` | Higher durable sequence marks it `SUPERSEDED` |
| Raw runtime transfer | Old live `FULL_RESEED` sample can remain | Latest completed cycle is stored while idle |
| API consistency | API correction can hide raw DB drift | API and raw runtime share the same cycle |
| Restart behavior | Reprojection can repeat ambiguous cleanup | `completed IS NULL` makes cleanup idempotent |
| Schema | A new cleanup table might appear necessary | Existing cycle and runtime columns are reused |

## 8. Implementation And Deployment Verification

The 2026-08-12 test deployment completed with the following evidence:

- Cloud disaster-recovery module tests: 138 passed, 0 failed;
- changed Cloud module package: build success from the WSL ext4 clone;
- changed-class-only deployment: runtime adapter and sync-cycle DAO classes;
- active web application: `WEB-INF` preserved and `/client/` returned HTTP 200;
- FTCTL GitHub Actions Run 31574728760: success for commit `1675db811b`;
- FTCTL RPM SHA-256:
  `10b09e8dca8d50758e33a2e9c2d3e602809c491193d7d38d9e3b0cdc42216626`;
- all three hosts: FTCTL 0.9.5 installed and timer active;
- coordinator scheduler: `RUNNING/HEALTHY` after the package restart;
- plan 43 legacy cycle 523: `SUPERSEDED`;
- plan 43 reverse cycle 527: `CONSUMED`;
- latest cycle 536: `READY/CBT_INCREMENTAL`, 2,031,616 transferred bytes;
- raw runtime and API both identify cycle 536 with no projection error;
- no active Run exists and the latest Failback session remains terminal-success.
