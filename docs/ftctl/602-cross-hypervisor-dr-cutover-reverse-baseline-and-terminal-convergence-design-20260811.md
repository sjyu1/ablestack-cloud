- Date: 2026-08-11
- Status: implementation contract
- Scope: UI, API, Cloud backend, Agent, FTCTL, DB
- Engine companion: `ablestack-qemu-exec-tools/docs/ftctl/456-ftctl-dr-cutover-reverse-baseline-and-terminal-convergence-design-20260811.md`

## 1. Root Cause

The data mover correctly fell back to a full reverse seed because no durable
KVM baseline existed. The missing step was earlier: Failover did not snapshot
the fully synchronized KVM replica before guest preparation and activation.
Separately, Cloud marked the Failback Run and Plan complete while persisting the
raw FTCTL `SYNCING / protection-resuming` payload as the latest runtime JSON.
The UI merged that stale payload over the terminal DB state.

## 2. Cross-Layer Contract

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| UI | Submit asynchronous actions; display effective reverse mode, bytes, and authoritative terminal state |
| API | Reuse existing Failback preflight and Run fields; no synchronous transfer wait |
| Backend | Persist a normalized terminal runtime snapshot without dropping transfer evidence |
| Agent | Relay FTCTL status and preflight fields unchanged |
| FTCTL | Create cutover baseline, perform extent transfer, publish terminal state |
| DB | Persist existing Run/session/runtime JSON atomically; no schema migration |

## 3. State And Data Flow

```text
Failover final CBT durable
  -> FTCTL RBD cutover snapshots
  -> baseline.json origin=FAILOVER_CUTOVER
  -> TARGET authority
  -> KVM guest changes
  -> Failback preflight effectiveMode=REVERSE_FINAL
  -> rbd diff extents -> VDDK writes
  -> VMware boot and Cloud authority commit
  -> required forward CBT checkpoint
  -> FTCTL READY/COMPLETED
  -> Cloud normalized terminal snapshot
  -> UI READY with retained transfer metrics
```

## 4. Backend And UI Design

`DrFailbackLifecycleServiceImpl.completeLifecycle` must deep-copy the latest
runtime JSON and normalize only lifecycle fields: state, step, progress,
Failback phase, scheduler health, transfer activity, terminal authority, and
errors. Checkpoint identity, byte counts, effective mode, throughput, and
baseline generation remain untouched.

`DrProtectionInfoTab.protectionPlan` normally merges runtime over the plan. If
the latest Run is a successful `FAILBACK`, it must project `READY`, completed
phase, 100 percent, idle transfer activity, and terminal authority. This is a
defensive rule for one refresh interval or legacy cached rows; live running
Failback data remains runtime-driven.

## 5. API, Agent, And DB Impact

- API: no new command and no blocking call; existing `effectivemode`,
  `initialseedrequired`, checkpoint, and transfer byte fields are normative.
- Agent: no new dispatch contract; it transports new FTCTL status markers via
  the existing status envelope.
- DB: no DDL. Existing `dr_run.last_status_json`, Failback session details,
  plan state, replica runtime JSON, and cutover authority are updated in one
  transaction.

## 6. Acceptance Gates

1. Pre-Failover state is SOURCE/READY and the latest forward checkpoint is durable.
2. Failover creates a baseline with `origin=FAILOVER_CUTOVER` before target power-on.
3. A small KVM guest write is made after Failover.
4. Failback preflight reports `REVERSE_FINAL`, `initialSeedRequired=false`.
5. `0 < transferPayloadBytes < virtualBytes`; mode is not `FULL_REVERSE_SEED`.
6. VMware boots and contains the guest write.
7. Run, Failback session, Plan, replica, FTCTL status, and UI all report terminal success.
8. The following forward cycle uses VMware CBT incrementally.

## 7. AS-IS / TO-BE

| Component | AS-IS | TO-BE |
|---|---|---|
| UI | Stale runtime `SYNCING` can override successful Run | Successful Failback terminal state wins |
| API | Correct fields exist but baseline is absent | Existing fields prove cutover baseline and reverse delta |
| Backend | Stores raw transitional runtime on completion | Stores normalized terminal snapshot and retained evidence |
| Agent | Relays transitional status | Relays FTCTL authoritative terminal markers |
| FTCTL | Baseline begins at first full Failback | Baseline begins at Failover cutover |
| DB | Run terminal and runtime JSON can disagree | Transactionally consistent terminal records |
