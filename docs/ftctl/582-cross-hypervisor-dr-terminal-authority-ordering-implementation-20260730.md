## Purpose

This document supplements the post-failover runtime and UI convergence design.
It records a correction found by live preflight after deployment.

## Observed State

The deployed environment contained this valid cutover evidence:

```text
Plan: FAILED_OVER
Active side: TARGET
Cutover session: FAILED_OVER / PROMOTED / ACKNOWLEDGED
```

The older runtime row still contained a larger scheduler lease and authority
sequence:

```text
Scheduler: STOPPED
Desired scheduler state: RUNNING
Owner matched: true
Protection state: DEGRADED
```

The Cloud projection rejected the lower terminal FTCTL status before checking
the committed cutover session. The UI consequently displayed a stale warning
even though the target VM was the committed serving authority.

## Authority Ordering Contract

For a normal SOURCE-side protection lifecycle, Cloud rejects a lower scheduler
lease or authority sequence. After a committed cutover, the cutover session is
the durable authority and the old forward scheduler no longer owns the plan.

`FtctlDrRuntimeProjectionAdapter.projectProtectionAuthority()` therefore uses
this ordering:

1. Resolve committed TARGET authority from `dr_cutover_session`.
2. If the Plan is `FAILED_OVER/TARGET` and the session is
   `FAILED_OVER/PROMOTED/ACKNOWLEDGED`, bypass forward-scheduler stale sequence
   rejection.
3. Persist the canonical terminal tuple:
   - scheduler state `STOPPED`
   - desired scheduler state `STOPPED`
   - scheduler health `SUPPRESSED`
   - recovery state `SUPPRESSED`
   - replication activity `STOPPED`
   - scheduler PID not alive
   - owner not matched
   - no active worker identity
   - protection state `FAILED_OVER_UNPROTECTED`
4. Freeze displayed RPO at the cutover point. The authoritative value is
   `max(0, cutover_session.completed_at - last_source_checkpoint_at)`.
   This formula also repairs a legacy Plan whose `target_ready_rpo_seconds`
   was incorrectly aged after cutover.
5. Preserve lease and sequence rejection for every non-terminal protection
   state.
6. Idempotently backfill typed `dr_cutover_disk` rows from active replica disk
   records when an older committed session has no disk audit rows.

## Regression Test

`periodicAuthorityProjectionDoesNotReapplyTerminalReprotectError()` seeds the
existing runtime with:

```text
lease_epoch=99
authority_sequence=999
scheduler_desired_state=RUNNING
owner_matched=true
```

It then projects a lower-sequence terminal status backed by a committed cutover
session. The test requires the complete canonical terminal tuple and verifies
that the historical reprotect error does not replace current TARGET authority.

`committedTargetProjectionFreezesPlanRpoAtCutover()` seeds a stale 6500-second
Plan RPO and requires both Plan and runtime projection to converge to the
209-second cutover RPO, regardless of the host status query time.

## AS-IS / TO-BE

| Layer | AS-IS | TO-BE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud projection | Scheduler sequence checked before cutover authority | Committed cutover authority checked first |
| Runtime DB | `STOPPED/RUNNING/DEGRADED`, owner still matched | `STOPPED/STOPPED/FAILED_OVER_UNPROTECTED`, owner false |
| RPO | Continued aging after cutover | Frozen at the committed target-ready RPO |
| Disk audit | Legacy committed session may have zero typed rows | Projection backfills one row per replica disk |
| UI/API | Historical scheduler warning appeared current | Current TARGET authority is informational and actionable |
| Safety | Lower sequence always rejected | Rejection retained except for durable terminal TARGET authority |

## Implementation And Deployment Verification

The final implementation was verified on 2026-07-30 as follows:

- `FtctlDrRuntimeProjectionAdapterTest`: 25 tests passed, with no failures or
  errors.
- The changed Disaster Recovery Maven module packaged successfully from the
  WSL ext4 build clone.
- The Cloud deployment updated only
  `FtctlDrRuntimeProjectionAdapter.class` and `DrCutoverDiskVO.class` in the
  management JAR.
- The active management webapp retained `WEB-INF`, and `/client/` returned
  HTTP 200 after restart.
- FTCTL GitHub Actions run `30511607024` completed successfully for commit
  `d6cf1a3403dedd1c83ac35b409ba72ea549be4d8`.
- All three DR compute hosts run `ablestack_vm_ftctl-0.9.1-1.noarch`, with
  `mold-agent` and `ablestack-vm-ftctl.timer` active.

The live Windows DR Plan
`2514a846-64a2-4bc7-ba88-38a874410782` converged to:

```text
Plan state: FAILED_OVER
Active side: TARGET
Protection state: FAILED_OVER_UNPROTECTED
Scheduler: STOPPED / desired STOPPED
Scheduler health and recovery: SUPPRESSED
Replication activity: STOPPED
Owner matched: false
RPO mode: CUTOVER_FROZEN
Displayed RPO: 209 seconds, MET
Current severity: INFO
Active runs: 0
```

The legacy committed cutover session now has two typed disk audit rows. Both
are `RBD/PROMOTED`, reference the Cloud target volume IDs and UUIDs, and carry
checkpoint sequence `1192` plus the committed manifest SHA-256.
## 2026-07-30 Failback Terminal Ordering Follow-up

Failback terminal ordering은 `SOURCE authority commit -> scheduler baseline seed ->
immediate checkpoint -> Cutover authority end` 순서를 사용한다. 기준 checkpoint와
같은 sequence의 재개 cycle은 terminal 증거로 인정하지 않는다. 구체적인 API
수락, transition severity, DB 및 FTCTL 인계 계약은 문서 583을 따른다.
