# Cross-Hypervisor DR Completed Cycle List And Reverse Evidence Convergence Design

## 1. Scope

This change closes two read-model inconsistencies after a successful Failback:

- `listDrPlans` must summarize the durable sync cycle identified by
  `dr_plan_runtime.latest_completed_cycle_sequence` while replication is idle.
- FTCTL `dr-status` must resolve reverse evidence from the completed Failback
  Run, even after the resumed forward scheduler publishes a newer plan status.

It does not change the VDDK, RBD, CBT, snapshot, or transfer data paths.

The subsequent raw-runtime and old-cycle terminal contract is defined in
`607-cross-hypervisor-dr-sync-cycle-terminal-and-runtime-summary-convergence-design-20260812.md`.

## 2. Cloud Contract

`DrResponseGenerator` keeps live runtime transfer fields while an operation is
active. When `replication_activity=IDLE`, it queries
`DrSyncCycleDao.findLatestCompletedByPlanId(planId)` and uses that row only if
its sequence equals `DrPlanRuntimeVO.latestCompletedCycleSequence`.

The completed row projects the following list fields:

- `transferActivityState=IDLE`
- `transferCycleSequence=dr_sync_cycle.sequence`
- `transferMode=dr_sync_cycle.effective_mode`
- total bytes from `virtual_bytes`
- processed and payload bytes from `transfer_payload_bytes`
- source read, target written, verified bytes, throughput, 100 percent, and
  zero ETA from the same row

A missing row or sequence mismatch is fail-closed: the response retains the
runtime projection and never combines fields from different cycles. The
Protection tab already follows the same sequence-equality rule.

## 3. FTCTL Contract

Reverse evidence is owned by the Failback Run that created the durable reverse
checkpoint. FTCTL stores `reverse_evidence_run_uuid` in the Run and plan status,
and also overlays it from `failbacks/active.json` after normal forward status
publication.

`dr-status` resolves evidence in this order:

1. explicit `reverse_evidence_run_uuid`;
2. the Run UUID parsed from `failback_session_id=<plan>:<run>`;
3. current status `run`;
4. command Run, external job reference, and control request Run.

The first candidate with an existing Run state file is used. This keeps the
completed Failback checkpoint, tracker, writer, write-verification, and guest
compatibility evidence authoritative while normal forward replication resumes.

## 4. Layer Impact

| Layer | Change |
|---|---|
| UI | No component change; the existing list receives coherent API fields |
| API | `listDrPlans` exposes one durable completed cycle while idle |
| Backend | Response generator joins runtime sequence to `dr_sync_cycle` |
| Agent | No protocol change |
| FTCTL | Completed Failback Run UUID is retained and preferred for evidence |
| DB | No schema change; existing runtime and cycle columns are used |

## 5. Verification

Cloud unit tests create an idle READY runtime with a stale FULL_RESEED sample
and a matching completed CBT_INCREMENTAL cycle. The response must expose only
the matching completed cycle metrics.

FTCTL selftests complete Failback, publish a forward scheduler Run over the plan
status, and require `reverse_evidence_state=COMPLETE` with the original Failback
Run UUID. Existing failback terminal, scheduler resume, and incremental tests
must remain green.

Runtime PASS requires all of the following:

- list and Protection APIs use the same latest completed cycle sequence;
- mode and byte metrics equal the `dr_sync_cycle` row for that sequence;
- `dr-status.reverse_evidence_state=COMPLETE`;
- `reverse_evidence_run_uuid` identifies the completed Failback Run;
- management, Agent, FTCTL timer, and plan scheduler services are healthy.

## 6. AS-IS / TO-BE

| Area | AS-IS | TO-BE |
|---|---|---|
| Plan list transfer | Old live FULL_RESEED sample can survive IDLE | Matching latest completed cycle is projected |
| Cycle identity | Sequence, mode, and bytes may come from different ages | All summary fields come from one `dr_sync_cycle` row |
| Reverse evidence owner | Current forward Run is selected first | Completed Failback Run is selected first |
| Post-Failback status | Forward publish can produce `INCONSISTENT` evidence | Durable reverse evidence remains `COMPLETE` |
| Storage | Additional state or columns might appear necessary | Existing Run sidecar and DB columns are reused |
