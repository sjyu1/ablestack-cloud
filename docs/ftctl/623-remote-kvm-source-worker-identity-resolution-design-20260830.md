# Remote KVM Source Worker Identity Resolution

## Problem

An ABLESTACK-to-ABLESTACK Plan may keep the source VM as an external
reference. In that case `source_worker_host_id` is intentionally local-site
only and can be null. A Plan created or refreshed while the source VM is
stopped can also omit `sourceHostUuid` from `mapping_json`.

The runtime status, capability, and action paths previously parsed that static
mapping independently. A missing value therefore changed an otherwise durable
Plan into `DR_ENGINE_UNAVAILABLE`, disabled every UI recovery action, and hid
the fact that the source VM could be started on a valid remote worker.

## Superseded Contract

1. Remote KVM worker identity has one resolver owned by
   `DrRemoteAgentClient`.
2. The resolver checked current Mold VM inventory first. Treating this
   observation as worker authority was incorrect because placement can change
   through live migration.
3. Persisting the resolved UUID into the Plan root, source, or source hardware
   mapping is prohibited. An observed host may be kept only as timestamped
   diagnostic evidence.
4. A stopped VM, unavailable source, or missing host must not globally disable
   DR actions. Action-aware capability and worker scheduling follow design 627.
5. Runtime projection, action dispatch, and capability calculation use this
   same resolver. They must not implement independent JSON parsing.
6. The resolver is active only for remote `KVM_TO_KVM` Plans. VMware-to-RBD and
   local RBD-to-RBD behavior remains unchanged.

## UI Acceptance

A stopped SharedMountPoint VM must remain synchronizable without a host ID.
Disaster Failover, Test Failover, cleanup, and release must remain available
from target capability and durable recovery evidence without source access.
Live migration must cause command-time re-resolution, not Plan mutation.
