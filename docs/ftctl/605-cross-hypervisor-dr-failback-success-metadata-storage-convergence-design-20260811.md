# Cross-Hypervisor DR Failback Success Metadata Storage Convergence Design

Date: 2026-08-11

## 1. Purpose

Ensure that a successful Failback is terminally consistent in the Cloud DB as
well as in FTCTL, Run history, API responses, and the UI. A completed session
must not retain `failure_phase`, `failed_component`, `error_code`, or
`error_message` from an earlier runtime sample.

## 2. Verified Failure

The live plan `ef73f5f3-9740-4bbd-8c9a-74a972e5f19f` completed Sync,
Failover, and Failback successfully. FTCTL reported an empty failure component,
the terminal details JSON contained no failure keys, and the API correctly
omitted failure fields. The `dr_failback_session` row nevertheless retained
`failed_component=ftctl`.

Two write paths permit this mismatch:

1. `completeLifecycle` relies on ordinary entity setters for NULL assignment
   instead of an explicit nullable `UpdateBuilder` update.
2. `reconcile` updates runtime evidence before it checks whether the persisted
   session is already terminal, allowing a late READY sample or a stale caller
   to retain failure metadata.

## 3. Storage Contract

For `state=COMPLETED`:

- `failure_phase IS NULL`;
- `failed_component IS NULL`;
- `error_code IS NULL`;
- `error_message IS NULL`;
- the terminal Run is `SUCCEEDED` with no errors;
- the persisted terminal details JSON contains no failure keys.

Violation of this contract prevents terminal completion from being committed.

## 4. Code-Level Design

### 4.1 DAO

Add `DrFailbackSessionDao.clearFailureMetadata(long sessionId)`. The DAO uses a
fresh update entity plus `UpdateBuilder.set(..., null)` for all four nullable
columns. This guarantees SQL NULL assignment rather than depending on ordinary
entity dirty tracking.

### 4.2 Lifecycle Service

`reconcile` checks terminal state immediately after locating the session and
before `updateRuntimeEvidence`. A completed session is sanitized through the
DAO and returned without consuming late runtime failure metadata.

`completeLifecycle` performs these operations in one transaction:

1. persist the completed session, successful Run, READY plan, and replica;
2. explicitly clear all four failure columns through the DAO;
3. re-read the session;
4. throw and roll back if any failure metadata remains.

The in-memory object is also cleared so the caller cannot return stale fields.

### 4.3 API And UI

No additional API or UI code is required. Snapshot version 11 already omits
failure-only fields for a successful session. This change makes the storage
source agree with that projection.

### 4.4 Agent And FTCTL

No Agent or FTCTL change is required. FTCTL already publishes empty failure
metadata after successful completion and remains the authority for runtime
state.

### 4.5 Database

No schema migration is required. Test-environment cleanup is restricted to the
verified plan and rows that satisfy all of the following:

- `state='COMPLETED'`;
- `error_code` and `error_message` are NULL or blank;
- one or more failure metadata columns are nonblank.

## 5. Test Design

Backend tests cover:

- a completed session followed by a late runtime sample containing stale
  failure metadata;
- terminal guard execution before runtime evidence update;
- explicit DAO clear invocation;
- local returned object sanitization;
- terminal runtime JSON without failure keys.

Deployment verification covers:

- module tests and package build from the WSL ext4 clone;
- changed-class-only Cloud deployment;
- bounded cleanup of existing completed rows;
- API, DB, FTCTL, Run history, VM power state, and service health agreement.

## 6. Retest Gate

The operator may run Failover and Failback only after:

1. the plan is READY and authority is SOURCE;
2. the scheduler is RUNNING/HEALTHY and replication is IDLE;
3. latest completed cycle metrics match between FTCTL, DB, and API;
4. no active Run exists;
5. the latest completed Failback session has no failure metadata.

## 7. AS-IS / TO-BE

| Area | AS-IS | TO-BE |
|---|---|---|
| DB NULL update | Ordinary setter can leave prior text in storage | Explicit `UpdateBuilder` writes SQL NULL |
| Late projection | Runtime evidence is consumed before terminal check | Terminal guard runs before evidence update |
| Completion assertion | Success is committed without storage read-back | Failure metadata is re-read and asserted in transaction |
| Existing rows | Successful sessions can retain `ftctl` | Only verified successful rows are cleaned |
| API/UI | Failure fields are hidden by projection | Projection and durable DB source agree |
| Engine | Correct success evidence already exists | No Agent/FTCTL behavior change |
