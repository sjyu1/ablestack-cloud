# QCOW2 DR 13 Test Environment Deployment

## Purpose And Scope

This document records the test-release deployment prepared for local-qcow2 DR
validation involving the 13 cluster. The initial approved scope covered the
management server `10.10.13.10` and compute host `10.10.13.1`. The same
release was additionally deployed to `10.10.13.2` on 2026-08-27 and to
`10.10.13.3` on 2026-08-28.

The deployment establishes the Cloud, Agent, V2K/N2K, qemu-exec-tools, FTCTL,
and HangCTL software baseline. It does not create a DR site or plan and does
not by itself change the cluster storage topology.

is `0.9.5-1`.

## Artifact Integrity

The local staging files and the copies on both 13-cluster nodes were compared
before installation. All SHA256 values matched.

## Backup And Deployment

The management backup is stored at
`/root/qcow2-dr-release-backup-20260826` on `10.10.13.10`. It contains the
Cloud and Usage database dumps, installed package inventory, Cloud
configuration, management libraries, active webapp, and checksums.

The compute backup is stored at `/root/qcow2-dr-host-backup-20260826` on
`10.10.13.1`. The additional `10.10.13.2` deployment backup is stored at
`/root/qcow2-dr-host-backup-20260827`. The `10.10.13.3` deployment backup is
stored at `/root/qcow2-dr-host-backup-20260828-005000`. Each backup contains
the package inventory and the Cloud/ABLESTACK/qemu tool configuration and
installation trees.

All packages were installed with `aspkg`. The active Cloud webapp was kept at
`/usr/share/cloudstack-management/webapp`; `WEB-INF` was verified before and
after installation.

The management package cleanup script incorrectly moved three package-owned
JARs to `legacy-lib`, causing a temporary `ServerDaemon` class-load failure.
Only the three files confirmed by `aspkg -ql cloudstack-management` were
restored from the deployment quarantine. After restoration, management
started normally and package verification reported no missing package JARs.
This is the same package-cleanup protection required by the dual-cluster test
deployment procedure.

On `10.10.13.1`, `10.10.13.2`, and `10.10.13.3`, NBD was confirmed idle
before the module was loaded or reloaded. The persistent configuration is
`nbds_max=32` and `max_part=16`; devices `/dev/nbd16` through `/dev/nbd31`
were verified on all three hosts.

## Verification Results

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `mold`, `mold-usage` | active |
| `/client/` from management and external network | HTTP 200 |
| Active webapp `WEB-INF` | present |
| FTCTL UI bundle markers | present |
| Cloud DB schema | `4.23.0.0` |
| `cloud.dr.service.enabled` | `true` |
| DR site/plan API under administrator session | HTTP 200 |
| Active DR sites/plans/runs | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| `mold-agent` on `10.10.13.1`, `.2`, and `.3` | active; all hosts `Up/Enabled` |
| FTCTL and HangCTL timers on `.1`, `.2`, and `.3` | active |
| Runtime `nbds_max` on `.1`, `.2`, and `.3` | 32 |
| `dr_runtime.sh` SHA256 | `5c7d1537637df00a25a0a10a0691d95db0a2b3f67bed75ea81ebc6125375ecaa` |
| `dr_scheduler.sh` SHA256 | `004790aa6f5f35722d395a6cd6e7e9c11e3ae5ad3651e5c72460ab023180c1bf` |
| Connectivity from the 13-cluster deployment to 12/31 management SSH and UI | PASS |

## QCOW2 Test Precondition

The only active primary storage found on the 13 cluster at deployment time is
`primary-gfs`, a cluster-scoped `SharedMountPoint` at `/mnt/glue-gfs`. Package
deployment is complete, but a local-qcow2 to local-qcow2 functional test must
select a VM whose source and target disks are actually file-backed local
storage. The DR site/plan should not be created until that inventory is
confirmed in the UI and Cloud DB.

## Final State

The deployed scope (`10.10.13.10` and compute hosts `10.10.13.1`, `.2`, and
`.3`) is PASS. Host `10.10.13.3` is aligned to Agent
`4.23.0.0-Mold.Europa.202608261320.1` and DR tools `0.9.5-1`; `mold-agent`,
FTCTL, and HangCTL timers are active, NBD uses `nbds_max=32`, and Cloud reports
the host as `Up/Enabled`.

## 2026-08-31 Current Branch Test Release

Cluster 13 was upgraded from the working branches built by Cloud Actions Run
[`33376001864`](https://github.com/dhslove/ablestack-cloud/actions/runs/33376001864)
and qemu tools Run
[`33376444887`](https://github.com/dhslove/ablestack-qemu-exec-tools/actions/runs/33376444887).
The installed Cloud release is
`4.23.0.0-Mold.Europa.202608310915.1`; all DR tool packages remain release
`0.9.5-1` from the new qemu Run.

The management server had mixed SNAPSHOT/Europa package state before this
alignment and an expected package-owned aggregate JAR was absent. The service
was recovered only with the current package payload and then fully replaced
with the new coherent release. Postflight verification now reports Mold
active, `/client/` HTTP 200, `WEB-INF` present, expected UI markers present,
and 40 GiB free on `/`.

Hosts `13.1`, `13.2`, and `13.3` are `Up / Enabled`; their Agents and FTCTL
timers are active and their installed runtime/scheduler hashes match the
three-cluster release record. `13.2` continues to use SSH port `10022` while
the other 13-cluster nodes use port `22`.

## 2026-09-01 Five-cluster Current Branch Test Release

Cluster 13 was aligned with Cloud commit
`46c5b483bbd821008bf362e9a656d56b8b369410` from successful Actions Run
[`33500908830`](https://github.com/dhslove/ablestack-cloud/actions/runs/33500908830)
and qemu tools commit `469dbda3902d79256625dab9a3ab36f9d28df2f8`
from successful Run
[`33500674589`](https://github.com/dhslove/ablestack-qemu-exec-tools/actions/runs/33500674589).
The Cloud RPM artifact SHA256 is
`2d4a297c48564d5bd54cfecb6920f9f4c12f47bfa137d36318c0b742c777615a`.

The installed Cloud release is
`4.23.0.0-Mold.Europa.202609011108.1`; all five DR tool packages are release
`0.9.5-1`. A numerically newer package timestamp from an older source commit
was present before alignment. Package replacement therefore used the package
manager's explicit old-package mode, and the active aggregate JAR was verified
to report the intended newer source revision
`46c5b483bbd821008bf362e9a656d56b8b369410`.

Mold and usage are active, `/client/` returns HTTP 200, `WEB-INF` is present,
all expected UI markers are in the active bundle, and no package-owned JAR is
missing. The database contains 23 DR tables, DR service is enabled, all three
routing hosts are `Up`, and active Runs and leases are zero. All three Agents,
FTCTL timers, and HangCTL timers are active; at least 32 NBD devices and all
five DR tool packages are present. Runtime and scheduler SHA256 values are
respectively
`82c20687082fe0385119fba93a91c7249ae1b89116a7faf79f543eedf588a3a5`
and `1170968add33f0464e520889b63a280a48446707b71786e41201bc1c670c85f0`.

The `13.2` SSH exception remains port `10022`; every other node in this
cluster uses port `22`. Browser verification rendered the current release
string `v4.10.0-Europa-20260901-ALPHA1` from `/drplan`. Deployment staging was
removed after verification, and the pre-deployment backup remains at
`/root/dr-test-release-backup-20260901-2010` on every node.
