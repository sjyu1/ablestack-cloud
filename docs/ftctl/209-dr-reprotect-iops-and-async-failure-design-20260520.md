# 209. DR Re-protection IOPS and Async Failure Design

Date: 2026-05-20

## 1. Purpose

During DR re-protection from the adopted replica site back to the recovered site, remote replica resource preparation can fail before qemu FTCTL receives any profile or block-copy command.

The observed failure was:

```text
prepareFtctlDrReplicaResources failed with HTTP 431
The min IOPS must be greater than 0.
```

The source volumes reported `miniops=0` and `maxiops=0`. For CloudStack custom IOPS volume creation, zero is not a valid explicit IOPS value. In FTCTL Cloud-managed provisioning, zero must mean "unspecified" and must not be passed into create-volume APIs.

## 2. Scope

This design applies to Cloud-managed FTCTL provisioning in both directions and both Mold layouts:

- DR with remote Mold
- DR with current Mold
- HA Cloud-managed standby provisioning

The same rule must apply when the current operating VM is an adopted DR replica and is being protected again toward another site.

## 3. Principles

- Cloud owns VM, volume, NIC, network, storage, host placement, and lifecycle API calls.
- qemu FTCTL starts only after Cloud has prepared the target resources and returned a usable disk map.
- qemu FTCTL must not compensate for invalid Cloud volume-create parameters.
- IOPS values greater than zero are preserved.
- IOPS values that are null, zero, or negative are treated as unspecified.
- A submitted async registration job is not equivalent to protection success. The UI must follow the async job result and show failures.

## 4. Backend Design

Cloud normalizes FTCTL IOPS values at all Cloud-managed volume-provisioning boundaries:

1. Source Mold source-volume JSON generation omits `miniops` and `maxiops` when the source value is null or not greater than zero.
2. Target Mold remote replica parsing also normalizes received `miniops` and `maxiops` so older source Mold builds that still send zero do not break provisioning.
3. Local/current-Mold Cloud-managed standby volume creation applies the same normalization before constructing the create-volume command.
4. Positive custom IOPS values remain unchanged and are passed to CloudStack create-volume APIs.

This keeps DR current-Mold and remote-Mold behavior consistent and avoids a regression in HA Cloud-managed provisioning.

## 5. UI Design

The protection configuration dialog continues to close after `registerFtctlProtection` accepts an async job. However, it must register the job with the common async polling mechanism.

Expected behavior:

- On job submission, show the existing started message.
- Poll `queryAsyncJobResult` for the returned job id.
- On success, refresh FTCTL data.
- On failure, show the async job failure notification, including backend `errortext`, and refresh FTCTL data.

This prevents the operator from seeing a silent close/no-progress state when resource preparation failed before block copy started.

## 6. Failure Boundary

If replica resource preparation fails:

- no qemu FTCTL profile should be created;
- no block-copy job should start;
- the Cloud async job must fail with the provisioning error;
- the UI must surface that async failure;
- cleanup should focus on partial Cloud resources, not qemu runtime state, unless a previous profile already existed.

## 7. Verification

Validate with a DR adopted-replica re-protection flow:

1. Use a source VM whose Cloud volume rows have `min_iops=0` and `max_iops=0`.
2. Protect it toward a peer Mold and select target host, storage, and network.
3. Confirm target replica VM and volumes are created without `min IOPS must be greater than 0`.
4. Confirm qemu FTCTL profile is created only after the Cloud resource preparation succeeds.
5. Confirm block copy starts normally.
6. Force a backend registration failure and confirm the UI reports the async job failure instead of only closing the dialog.
