# Cross Hypervisor DR VMware Snapshot Cleanup And Durable Projection Design

## 1. Scope

This design keeps Cloud's completed-cycle projection consistent when FTCTL has
durably committed VMware data but still has temporary source snapshot cleanup
work. It does not change the validated VMware to ABLESTACK RBD data path.

## 2. State Separation

| Fact | Authority | Projection rule |
|---|---|---|
| Current scheduler activity | FTCTL current status | may be `WAITING_CLEANUP` or degraded |
| Last durable replication | FTCTL latest completed cycle | remains completed and usable |
| Snapshot maintenance | FTCTL source snapshot lifecycle | warning/retry state, not data rollback |

Cloud must choose `latestCompletedCycleSequence` before the legacy
`latestCompletedCheckpointSequence` when locating and committing the canonical
`dr_sync_cycle`. Current errors must not erase or regress that completed row.

## 3. Projection Flow

```text
Mold Agent -> FtctlDrStatusAnswer
  current cycle: WAITING_CLEANUP
  latest completed cycle: LOCAL_DURABLE N
        |
        v
FtctlDrRuntimeProjectionAdapter
  project current maintenance state
  project completed cycle N independently
        |
        v
dr_plan_runtime.latest_completed_cycle_sequence = N
dr_sync_cycle(plan, N) = READY / LOCAL_DURABLE
```

## 4. AS-IS / TO-BE

| Area | AS-IS | TO-BE |
|---|---|---|
| Sequence selection | several paths require checkpoint alias | explicit latest-cycle sequence preferred |
| Current failure | can prevent completed-cycle projection | current and completed projections are independent |
| History | durable reseed may be absent until next success | durable cycle is projected immediately |

## 5. Validation

- Unit test a status containing only `latestCompletedCycleSequence` and a
  coherent `LOCAL_DURABLE` snapshot.
- Verify `dr_sync_cycle` completion and runtime latest sequence are updated even
  if the current scheduler is degraded.
- After deployment, verify all three 32-cluster plans complete an automatic
  incremental or no-change cycle and expose it through list and detail APIs.

## 6. vCenter Certificate Rollover

Cloud distinguishes automatically discovered vCenter thumbprints from
operator-pinned values. Credentials marked `backend-auto`,
`backend-auto-refreshed`, or `backend-auto-fallback` are refreshed from the
registered vCenter endpoint whenever a DR command profile is rendered. A
`runtime` thumbprint remains pinned.

This keeps newly dispatched profiles consistent after a vCenter certificate
rollover. FTCTL independently refreshes the same automatic value at source-open
time so a persistent scheduler can recover without waiting for another UI/API
action. Snapshot cleanup state and the latest durable Cycle remain independent
from this transient source-authentication recovery.
