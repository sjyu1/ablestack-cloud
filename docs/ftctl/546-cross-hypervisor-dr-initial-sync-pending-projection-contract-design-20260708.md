# Cross Hypervisor DR Initial Sync Pending Projection Contract Design

Date: 2026-07-08

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the structural fix for the VMware to ABLESTACK DR sync
test using plan `9bb2739b-597c-4c9a-a603-f3edf5abfd60` and run
`cf079366-e0cf-4c6d-b55a-ea0e09151544`.

The live runtime showed real progress:

| Item | Observed value |
| --- | --- |
| Cloud plan state | `SYNCING` |
| Cloud run state | `ACCEPTED` |
| Cloud run projection | `syncing`, `runtime-projection` |
| Cloud run error | `DR_TARGET_VM_NOT_FOUND` |
| FTCTL state | `SYNCING` |
| FTCTL step | `full-seed-transfer` |
| FTCTL progress | `40` |
| FTCTL worker | `RUNNING` |
| FTCTL error | empty |
| Target storage | RBD image exists and is growing |
| Target VM | not materialized yet |
| Restore point | not created yet |

This is not an engine failure. Initial full-seed is still running. The target
VM is intentionally absent until a durable target restore point exists. The bug
is that Cloud projection writes a pending condition into `dr_run.error_code`,
and API/UI then renders it as a failure.

## 2. Confirmed Live Preflight

The live environment was checked before this design was written.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| VDDK source open | `source_open.ready=true` |
| VMware snapshot | `source_snapshot.ready=true`, snapshot ref present |
| CBT | `enabled=true`, VM CBT enabled |
| Data mover | `nbdkit vddk` process running |
| Target writer | `qemu-img convert` process running |
| Target RBD | `Rokcy10-1-dr-disk-0`, 100 GiB |
| RBD used size | increased from 3.9 GiB to 5.3 GiB during observation |
| FTCTL status error | empty |
| DB restore points | `0`, expected before full-seed completion |

The previous `VixDiskLib_ConnectEx` and thumbprint failures have been passed.
The runtime has moved into the real transfer phase.

## 2.1 2026-07-09 Follow-Up: Durable Restore Point Is Not Target Ready

A later validation with plan `dd895181-7fff-43cc-bae6-24a5ab529db8` confirmed
the next boundary after this document:

- the initial seed and restore point path can succeed;
- `target_storage_present=true` and `restore_point_present=true`;
- the latest restore point can be `READY`;
- but `target_vm_present=false`, `target_network_present=false`, and
  `dr_replica.target_vm_id` can remain empty.

That state is no longer initial seed. It must not continue to look like generic
`40%` data transfer. It is the target materialization phase and requires a
Cloud-owned async worker to import/adopt the seeded disk as a managed volume,
deploy a stopped target VM from the imported root volume, update DR DB
references, and send the target refs back to FTCTL.

The detailed follow-up contract is defined in:

- `547-cross-hypervisor-dr-target-vm-materialization-contract-design-20260709.md`

## 3. Root Cause

Current backend code in `FtctlDrRuntimeProjectionAdapter.markSyncTargetPending`
mixes two different concepts:

1. Terminal error: the engine has failed and the operator must intervene.
2. Pending materialization: the engine is still copying data and the target VM
   does not exist yet by design.

The current behavior writes `DR_TARGET_VM_NOT_FOUND` when
`hasTargetReferenceForDirection(plan)` is false, even if FTCTL reports
`SYNCING/full-seed-transfer`, `worker_state=RUNNING`, and empty runtime
`error_code`.

`DR_TARGET_VM_NOT_FOUND` is valid only after the runtime has reached a phase
where a target VM reference is expected.

## 4. Target State Contract

| Runtime condition | Meaning | Cloud projection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNCING/full-seed-transfer`, `worker_state=RUNNING`, no runtime error, `target_storage_present=true`, `target_vm_present=false` | Initial seed is copying data. Target VM is not expected yet. | Run stays active. No error code. |
| `last_target_durable_at` empty and `restore_point_present=false` | No usable restore point yet. | Progress view says "initial sync in progress". |
| `last_target_durable_at` present and `restore_point_present=true`, but target VM reference absent | The disk is durable; VM materialization should now happen. | `projection_state=target-materializing`; no failure until grace expires. |
| `READY` or `TARGET_READY` but target VM/reference missing | Runtime says ready but Cloud cannot find target VM. | Terminal projection error. |
| Runtime `ERROR`/`FAILED`, `worker_state=FAILED`, or non-empty runtime `error_code` | Engine failure. | Terminal projection error. |

Do not write pending states into error columns.

| DB field | Pending full-seed | Terminal failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dr_run.error_code` | `NULL` | specific error code |
| `dr_run.error_message` | `NULL` | short operator message |
| `dr_run_step.error_code` | `NULL` for `RUNNING` pending step | specific error code |
| `dr_plan.last_error_code` | unchanged or cleared when runtime is healthy | specific error code |
| API `runtimeErrorCode` | empty | specific error code |

## 5. UI Layer Design

Affected files:

```text
ui/src/utils/dr/resourceActions.js
ui/src/views/infra/dr/DrPlanList.vue
ui/src/views/infra/dr/DrPlanOverview.vue
ui/src/views/infra/dr/DrRunsTab.vue
ui/src/components/dr/DrRunProgress.vue
ui/public/locales/en-US.json
ui/public/locales/ko-KR.json
```

Current logic treats any run error code as runtime failure. TO-BE failure
detection must require terminal evidence:

```js
const PENDING_RUNTIME_CODES = new Set([
  'DR_TARGET_VM_NOT_MATERIALIZED',
  'DR_TARGET_VM_PENDING',
  'DR_TARGET_RESTORE_POINT_PENDING'
])

function hasRuntimeFailure (resource) {
  const runtime = upper(resource?.runtimestate || resource?.runtimeState)
  const worker = upper(resource?.lastrun?.workerstate || resource?.lastrun?.workerState)
  const runState = upper(resource?.lastrun?.state || resource?.lastRun?.state)
  const runtimeCode = upper(resource?.runtimeerrorcode || resource?.runtimeErrorCode ||
    resource?.lastrun?.runtimeerrorcode || resource?.lastRun?.runtimeErrorCode)

  if (runtime === 'ERROR' || runtime === 'FAILED' || worker === 'FAILED' || runState === 'FAILED') {
    return true
  }
  return !!runtimeCode && !PENDING_RUNTIME_CODES.has(runtimeCode)
}
```

Visible status rules:

| API evidence | UI status |
| --- | --- |
| active run + `runtimeState=SYNCING` + `runtimeStep=full-seed-transfer` | `Initial sync in progress` |
| `targetStoragePresent=true`, `targetVmPresent=false`, no runtime error | `Target disk prepared, target VM pending` |
| durable checkpoint present, target VM pending | `Target VM materializing` |
| target VM, restore point, durable checkpoint present | `Recovery ready` |
| terminal runtime error | `Failed` |

Failover/test failover remain disabled until `targetMaterialized=true`,
`restorePointPresent=true`, and no runtime failure.

## 6. API Layer Design

Affected files:

```text
plugins/integrations/disaster-recovery/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/api/response/dr/DrPlanResponse.java
plugins/integrations/disaster-recovery/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/api/response/dr/DrRunResponse.java

plugins/integrations/disaster-recovery/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/api/command/admin/dr/ListDrRunsCmd.java
```

Add or consistently populate non-error pending fields:

```java
@SerializedName("targetmaterializationstate")
private String targetMaterializationState; // NOT_STARTED, DISK_SEEDING, RESTORE_POINT_READY, VM_MATERIALIZING, READY

@SerializedName("targetmaterializationmessage")
private String targetMaterializationMessage;

@SerializedName("initialsyncinprogress")
private Boolean initialSyncInProgress;
```

If adding fields is deferred, compute the same semantic state in response
generation and UI normalization without a DB migration.

`DrResponseGenerator` must not promote `run.errorCode` to `runtimeErrorCode`
when the runtime payload is healthy and the run is active.

```java
private String visibleRuntimeErrorCode(DrRunVO run, JsonObject runtime) {
    String runtimeState = StringUtils.upperCase(firstString(runtime, "state"));
    String workerState = StringUtils.upperCase(firstString(runtime, "worker_state"));
    String runtimeErrorCode = firstString(runtime, "error_code");
    if (StringUtils.isNotBlank(runtimeErrorCode)) {
        return runtimeErrorCode;
    }
    if (StringUtils.equalsAny(runtimeState, "ERROR", "FAILED")
            || StringUtils.equals(workerState, "FAILED")
            || StringUtils.equals(run.getState(), DrConstants.RUN_STATE_FAILED)) {
        return run.getErrorCode();
    }
    return null;
}
```

```

### 7.1 `markSyncTargetPending`

Change the method so healthy active sync never writes an error code.

```java
private void markSyncTargetPending(DrPlanVO plan, DrRunVO run,
        FtctlDrStatusAnswer status, JsonObject runtime) {
    if (run == null || run.getCompleted() != null) {
        return;
    }

    boolean targetReferencePresent = hasTargetReferenceForDirection(plan);
    boolean durablePresent = hasDurableCheckpoint(status, runtime);
    String runtimeState = runtimeState(status, runtime);
    boolean initialSeedRunning = StringUtils.equalsAny(runtimeState, "SYNCING", "RUNNING")
            && !durablePresent
            && !targetReferencePresent;

    String projectionState = durablePresent && !targetReferencePresent
            ? "target-materializing"
            : "syncing";
    String message = initialSeedRunning
            ? "FTCTL_DR initial seed is copying data; target VM will be materialized after a durable restore point exists"
            : durablePresent && !targetReferencePresent
                ? "FTCTL_DR sync has a durable restore point and is materializing the target VM"
                : "FTCTL_DR sync is still materializing target restore point";

    int progress = status.getProgress() != null
            ? Math.max(1, Math.min(status.getProgress(), 99))
            : (durablePresent ? 95 : 40);
    String compactStatusJson = compactRuntimeStatusJson(status.getStatusJson());

    recordRunProjectionStep(run, DrConstants.STEP_STATE_RUNNING, progress,
            compactStatusJson, null, null);
    run.setProjectionState(projectionState);
    run.setProjectionChecked(new Date());
    run.setCurrentStepName(durablePresent && !targetReferencePresent
            ? "target-materializing"
            : "initial-sync");
    run.setLastStatusJson(compactStatusJson);
    run.setErrorCode(null);
    run.setErrorMessage(null);
    run.markUpdated();
    drRunDao.update(run.getId(), run);

    clearHealthyProjectionError(plan);
}
```

### 7.2 Terminal Target VM Missing

Use `DR_TARGET_VM_NOT_FOUND` only when the target VM reference is required:

```java
private boolean isTargetReferenceMissingTerminal(DrPlanVO plan,
        FtctlDrStatusAnswer status, JsonObject runtime) {
    String runtimeState = runtimeState(status, runtime);
    boolean durablePresent = hasDurableCheckpoint(status, runtime);
    boolean restorePointPresent = isExplicitTrue(status.getRestorePointPresent(),
            booleanValue(runtime, "restore_point_present"));
    boolean readyRuntime = StringUtils.equalsAny(runtimeState, "READY", "TARGET_READY");
    return !hasTargetReferenceForDirection(plan)
            && (readyRuntime || (durablePresent && restorePointPresent && materializationGraceExpired(plan)));
}
```

When this returns true, fail projection with `DR_TARGET_VM_NOT_FOUND`.

### 7.3 Clear Stale Errors

If a later projection sees healthy `SYNCING` runtime with no runtime error,
clear stale plan/run/step errors instead of preserving them.

```java
private void clearHealthyProjectionError(DrPlanVO plan) {
    DrPlanVO latest = drPlanDao.findById(plan.getId());
    if (latest != null && StringUtils.equals(latest.getState(), DrConstants.PLAN_STATE_SYNCING)) {
        latest.setLastErrorCode(null);
        latest.setLastErrorMessage(null);
        latest.markUpdated();
        drPlanDao.update(latest.getId(), latest);
    }
}
```

### 7.4 Tests

Add tests:

```java
@Test
public void refreshPlanProjectionKeepsInitialSeedPendingRunHealthyWhenTargetVmIsAbsent() {
    // runtime: SYNCING/full-seed-transfer, worker RUNNING, no error,
    // target_storage_present=true, target_vm_present=false,
    // restore_point_present=false
    // expect: run ACCEPTED, projection_state=syncing, errorCode=null,
    // step RUNNING with errorCode=null, plan not ERROR
}

@Test
public void responseGeneratorDoesNotExposeRunErrorCodeAsRuntimeErrorForHealthyActiveRuntime() {
    // run has stale DR_TARGET_VM_NOT_FOUND, runtime has SYNCING and empty error_code
    // expect: runtimeErrorCode null, effectiveState SYNCING
}
```

## 8. Agent Layer Design

No Agent protocol change is required.

Current `FtctlDrStatusAnswer` already transports the needed distinction:

```text
state=SYNCING
step=full-seed-transfer
progress=40
targetStoragePresent=true
targetVmPresent=false
targetNetworkPresent=false
restorePointPresent=false
errorCode=
```

Agent responsibility remains:

1. Run bounded `dr-status`.
2. Preserve `errorCode` exactly as FTCTL emits it.
3. Do not synthesize target VM errors from boolean readiness fields.

## 9. FTCTL Layer Design

No blocking FTCTL change is required for this failure.

FTCTL already emits the correct distinction:

| Field | Current value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `state` | `SYNCING` | active non-terminal work |
| `step` | `full-seed-transfer` | initial seed copy |
| `target_storage_present` | `true` | target disk exists |
| `target_vm_present` | `false` | target VM not materialized yet |
| `restore_point_present` | `false` | no durable restore point yet |
| `error_code` | empty | not failed |

Optional improvement: parse `qemu-img convert -p` progress or bytes written to
target RBD and update runtime `progress` during full-seed. This is a UX
improvement only and is not required to fix the false Fail.

## 10. DB Layer Design

No DB migration is required.

Use existing columns with stricter semantics:

| Table | Field | TO-BE discipline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dr_run` | `state` | stays `ACCEPTED` or `RUNNING` until terminal success/failure |
| `dr_run` | `projection_state` | `syncing`, `initial-sync`, `target-materializing`, `succeeded`, `failed` |
| `dr_run` | `error_code` | null for pending materialization |
| `dr_run` | `error_message` | null for pending materialization |
| `dr_run` | `last_status_json` | compact healthy runtime status retained |
| `dr_run_step` | `state` | `RUNNING` for `runtime-projection` while full-seed is active |
| `dr_run_step` | `error_code` | null for active pending status |
| `dr_plan` | `last_error_code` | cleared when healthy runtime projection arrives |
| `dr_restore_point` | row | created only after durable target checkpoint exists |
| `dr_replica` | `target_vm_id` | null before target VM materialization |

## 11. AS-IS / TO-BE Summary

| Layer | AS-IS | TO-BE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI | Any `runtimeErrorCode` or last-run `errorCode` makes the plan look failed. | Terminal runtime state or terminal run state is required for Fail; initial seed pending is shown as in progress. |
| API | `DrResponseGenerator` promotes stale `run.errorCode` into `runtimeErrorCode` even when FTCTL runtime is healthy. | `runtimeErrorCode` is emitted only from runtime error or terminal failed run. Pending messages use separate materialization state/message. |
| Backend | `markSyncTargetPending` writes `DR_TARGET_VM_NOT_FOUND` during healthy full-seed. | Pending target VM absence clears run/step error fields and stores `projection_state=syncing` or `target-materializing`. |
| Agent | Correctly forwards FTCTL status, but Cloud may misinterpret booleans. | No change; Agent does not synthesize errors from `target_vm_present=false`. |
| FTCTL | Emits correct `SYNCING` status but progress can remain coarse at 40. | No required fix; optional data-copy progress enrichment. |
| DB | Active run can contain error fields, causing UI/API false Fail. | Active healthy run has null error fields; only terminal failures write error fields. |
| Error cause | Looks like target VM missing failure. | It is a false projection failure during initial full-seed transfer. |
| Next-step readiness | UI may imply Fail while data is still copying. | Next-step remains disabled but status is "initial sync in progress" until durable restore point and target VM exist. |

## 12. Implementation Order

1. Backend: update `markSyncTargetPending`, terminal target-missing check, and
   stale error clearing.
2. API: update `DrResponseGenerator` runtime error mapping and materialization
   message.
3. UI: update failure detection and labels for initial sync / target VM pending.
4. Tests: add backend projection and response generator unit tests.
5. Deployment cleanup: clear stale `DR_TARGET_VM_NOT_FOUND` from active healthy
   runs after deployment by forcing projection refresh, not by blind DB updates.

## 13. Implementation Update - 2026-07-08

Implemented scope:

| Layer | Implemented change |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | `FtctlDrRuntimeProjectionAdapter.markSyncTargetPending` no longer stores `DR_TARGET_VM_NOT_FOUND` for healthy initial seed. It records the projection step as `RUNNING`, clears active run error fields, and keeps `projection_state=syncing` or `target-materializing`. |
| Backend | `updatePlanFromStatus` clears stale plan-level last errors when FTCTL reports healthy `RUNNING`, `SYNCING`, `SEEDING`, `READY`, or `TARGET_READY` progress with no runtime error. |
| API | `DrResponseGenerator` exposes `runtimeErrorCode` only from FTCTL runtime error fields or terminal failed runs. Active sync run error residue is not promoted to runtime failure. |
| API | `DrPlanResponse` now exposes `initialsyncinprogress`, `targetmaterializationstate`, and `targetmaterializationmessage` as derived response fields. No DB migration is required. |
| UI | DR plan list/action eligibility checks no longer treat active run `errorcode` as failure unless the run state is terminal `FAILED`. |
| UI | DR plan overview and run progress suppress active-run stale error text and show target materialization state/detail labels. |
| Tests | Added adapter coverage for VMware-to-KVM initial full-seed where target storage exists but target VM and restore point do not yet exist. |

Deployment cleanup should still prefer a normal projection refresh after
deployment. Direct DB cleanup is only a fallback if a stale active run cannot be
refreshed through the backend.
