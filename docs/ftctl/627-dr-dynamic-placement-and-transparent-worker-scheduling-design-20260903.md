# DR Dynamic Placement and Transparent Worker Scheduling Design

## 1. Decision

DR plans describe workload identity, sites, storage and network policy, and
RPO/RTO. They must not freeze transient infrastructure placement. VM host,
coordinator host, and transfer worker are runtime observations or leases, not
Plan authority.

The following are prohibited design patterns:

- persisting a VM's observed `hostid` as an immutable execution route;
- using `mapping_json.source.hardware.sourceHostUuid` or
  `sourceWorkerHostUuid` as a prerequisite for every action;
- treating a stopped VM's missing host as an unavailable replication engine;
- asking a normal UI user to select coordinator/source/target workers;
- reusing inventory snapshots as routing tables;
- rejecting disaster Failover because the source VM, source Agent, or source
  Mold cannot be reached.

These rules apply to VMware-to-RBD, RBD-to-RBD, and SharedMountPoint
qcow2-to-qcow2. Provider-specific data transfer remains isolated, but dynamic
placement is a common orchestration contract.

### 1.1 Scope guard

This design does not declare the existing DR lifecycle or data plane defective
and does not replace it. The already successful Plan, synchronization,
checkpoint, Test Failover, cleanup, Failover, Failback, Reprotect, release,
terminal projection, and provider implementations remain the baseline.

Only these three defects are in scope:

1. a transient VM/worker/coordinator host is persisted or reused as fixed
   execution authority;
2. a normal user is required to choose internal execution hosts;
3. VM power state or current host presence is used as a general condition for
   DR synchronization or recovery availability.

Implementation must remove those conditions without changing disk contents,
VM Details, checkpoint ordering, provider selection, authority transitions, or
the successful action state machine. A change outside this boundary requires a
separate design and regression justification.

## 2. AS-IS Failure

`DrFtctlActionCapabilityServiceImpl` selects the remote source Agent before it
knows which action is being evaluated. `DrRemoteAgentClient.sourceWorkerUuid()`
then resolves the VM's current `hostid` and persists it into `mapping_json`.
When a VM is stopped, migrated, or its source site is unavailable, the lookup
returns no host. One lookup exception is expanded to
`DR_ACTION_CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE` for every action.

This couples four independent concepts:

1. the VM's current compute placement;
2. an Agent capable of VM-local QMP control;
3. a worker capable of accessing shared storage and transferring data;
4. a coordinator that owns an operation lease.

The coupling violates virtualization semantics and makes recovery depend on
the infrastructure that DR is expected to survive.

## 3. Authority Boundaries

| Information | Authority | Persistence rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VM identity and replicable VM Details | Mold/vCenter inventory | Plan contract |
| Current VM host | Live Mold/vCenter query | Observation only, never execution authority |
| Eligible worker pool | Site inventory, Agent health, storage capability | Refreshable projection |
| Coordinator | Plan-scoped lease | Runtime only |
| Transfer worker | Cycle/disk-scoped lease | Runtime and audit evidence only |
| QMP control Agent | Current VM placement at command time | Command-local only |
| Durable recovery point | FTCTL checkpoint/cycle journal | Durable recovery authority |

`mapping_json` may carry `lastObservedHostUuid` for diagnostics. It must be
timestamped, must never be named `sourceWorkerHostUuid`, and must never enable,
disable, or route an action.

## 4. Runtime Resolvers

Cloud introduces explicit, action-aware services instead of a shared host-ID
shortcut:

```java
interface DrPlacementResolver {
    DrVmPlacement observeVmPlacement(DrPlanVO plan, DrSiteRole role);
    List<DrWorkerCandidate> listEligibleWorkers(DrPlanVO plan,
            DrWorkerRole role, DrAction action);
}

interface DrWorkerScheduler {
    DrWorkerLease acquire(DrPlanVO plan, DrRunVO run,
            DrWorkerRole role, DrWorkerRequirements requirements);
    DrWorkerLease reassign(DrWorkerLease failedLease, String reasonCode);
}
```

`observeVmPlacement()` always performs a current Mold/vCenter lookup. Its
result includes an observation generation or timestamp and is invalidated by
host migration. It is called only for an operation that actually needs
VM-local control.

`listEligibleWorkers()` selects from connected Agents in the relevant site and
checks FTCTL capability, maintenance state, storage reachability, transport
network reachability, resource slots, and recent failures. SharedMountPoint
file operations are not restricted to the VM's compute host.

This is a routing correction around the existing action implementation. The
resolver supplies the host that receives the same validated command; it does
not rebuild profiles, change provider logic, or reinterpret VM/disk metadata.

## 5. Scheduling Rules

### 5.1 Coordinator

The controller acquires a Plan/Run coordinator lease from the eligible pool.
The lease has an epoch, heartbeat, and expiry. A failed coordinator is replaced
without changing the Plan or checkpoint identity.

### 5.2 Transfer worker

A transfer worker is selected per Cycle and, when useful, per disk. Selection
uses storage access, provider capability, load, bandwidth and slot admission,
failure-domain spread, and backoff. The selected host is recorded as evidence,
not reused as future authority.

### 5.3 VM-local control

QMP, live snapshot, or guest-quiesce commands resolve the current VM host
immediately before dispatch. The command includes the observed VM placement
generation. `HOST_CHANGED` or Agent disconnect triggers a fresh lookup and a
bounded idempotent retry. A migration must not invalidate the transfer worker
lease after a durable checkpoint has been produced.

### 5.4 Stopped VM

A stopped VM is a valid source for file and block replication. For
SharedMountPoint qcow2, readiness is based on file accessibility, disk-set
mapping, checkpoint integrity, and writer/lease state. Missing `hostid` is not
an error. The stopped state selects the offline checkpoint path and does not
disable synchronization.

### 5.5 VMware source power and placement

A VMware source VM may be `POWERED_ON` or `POWERED_OFF` when protection is
created, Full Sync is requested, or periodic synchronization is evaluated.
Power state selects a consistency path; it is not global action eligibility:

- `POWERED_ON`: use the existing snapshot/CBT path and the configured
  crash-consistent or quiesced policy;
- `POWERED_OFF`: read the stable virtual-disk chain through VDDK and permit
  Full Seed; when a valid CBT baseline/change ID exists, permit incremental or
  `NO_CHANGE` completion without starting the VM;
- CBT configured but not yet activated: publish typed
  `CBT_PENDING_ACTIVATION` for incremental readiness. Do not start or power
  cycle the source automatically, do not invalidate an existing durable
  checkpoint, and do not block checkpoint-based Test Failover or disaster
  Failover;
- vCenter/source unavailable: periodic source replication may wait or degrade,
  while disaster Failover remains governed by target capability, fencing
  acknowledgement, and the last durable recovery point.

The ESXi host reported by vCenter is an observation only. vMotion/DRS may move
the VM at any time, so vCenter inventory and disk locators are refreshed for
each snapshot/CBT operation. No ESXi identity is persisted as Plan routing
authority.

The VDDK data-plane worker is a KVM-side worker, not the VMware VM's host. It
is automatically selected per Run/Cycle from connected workers that can load
VDDK and reach the required transport and target storage. A normal user never
selects it, and `targetWorkerHostId` is not a durable prerequisite.

## 6. Action-Aware Capability Matrix

| Action | Source Agent required | Target Agent required | Current VM host required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VMware Full Sync, source on or off | vCenter/VDDK source access | yes | no pinned ESXi host |
| VMware incremental, source off with valid CBT baseline | vCenter/VDDK source access | yes | no pinned ESXi host |
| Sync, running VM | only for checkpoint/QMP producer | yes | command-time only |
| Sync, stopped shared-file VM | no | yes | no |
| Test Failover | no after durable checkpoint | yes | no |
| Disaster Failover | no | yes | no |
| Planned Failover | yes for final checkpoint and source stop | yes | command-time only |
| Test Cleanup | no | yes | no |
| Release, retain target | no | target/controller only | no |
| Release, delete target | no | target/controller only | no |
| Failback/Reprotect | selected from current authority and destination roles | selected per direction | only for an actual VM lifecycle/QMP command |

Capability evaluation returns per-site and per-action results. Failure of one
site probe must not mark unrelated actions unavailable. Disaster recovery
actions use target capability and durable checkpoint evidence even when the
source site is absent.

## 7. UI Contract

The normal Plan wizard removes coordinator, source-worker, and target-worker
selectors. The user selects business policy and durable resources only:

- source and target sites;
- workload;
- target storage, network, and compute policy;
- RPO/RTO and consistency policy.

Preview reports `Automatic placement: READY`, eligible worker counts, storage
access, and blocking policy reasons. Detail and Run views show the actual
coordinator/worker as read-only runtime evidence, including lease epoch and
reassignment history.

An administrator-only advanced policy may exclude hosts, express preference,
or cap parallelism. It must not pin an execution host and must not be required
for Plan creation.

The UI consumes backend `actionavailability`. It must not allow submission when
the same snapshot reports a blocking capability reason, and it must never show
the Plan as generally `READY` while all actions are globally unavailable.

Plan list and detail page reads follow the DB-first read contract defined in
`628-dr-db-first-read-and-progressive-ui-design-20260904.md`. Page rendering
must not synchronously probe an Agent or FTCTL. A live capability validation is
performed only by an explicit action preflight or a background reconciliation
job, never by `listDrPlans`, `getDrPlan`, or `getDrProtectionView`.

VM power state is not a protection, synchronization, reprotection, or
failback-preflight prerequisite. Those paths are authorized by the committed
authority generation and a durable checkpoint set. Power-off and power-on
checks remain only inside an explicit cutover transaction when they are the
requested transition outcome, and destination boot validation remains a
post-materialization success criterion.

Preflight contracts must report `targetPowerState=NOT_REQUIRED` when they do
not perform a power probe. They must never manufacture `POWERED_ON` merely to
satisfy an older response shape. An observed power state may be exposed as
non-blocking evidence, while the execution transaction records actual stop,
start, and boot-validation outcomes separately.

## 8. Existing Plan Migration

No DB repair or Plan recreation is required.

1. Ignore `source_worker_host_id`, `target_worker_host_id`,
   `coordinator_worker_host_id`, `sourceWorkerHostUuid`, and
   `source.hardware.sourceHostUuid` for routing.
2. Preserve old values only as legacy audit data until a schema migration
   retires them.
3. Build the eligible pool from current site inventory on the next readiness
   refresh.
4. Reproject action availability per action and site.
5. Do not mutate VM Details, disk mappings, checkpoint identity, or validated
   provider behavior during migration.

Existing plans retain their successful runtime state and recovery points. The
next availability refresh changes only host selection and capability
projection; it must not force reseed, recreate a replica, or rewrite a target
VM.

## 9. Regression Gates

The following tests are mandatory before deployment:

1. running VM migrates between hosts before and during a Cycle;
2. stopped SharedMountPoint VM synchronizes with `host_id=NULL`;
3. source site unreachable while disaster Failover remains available;
4. coordinator failure causes lease-based reassignment;
5. transfer worker failure retries on another storage-capable worker;
6. one capability endpoint failure blocks only actions that need that site;
7. UI wizard contains no required worker selector;
8. UI action menu and backend submission use the same availability snapshot;
9. VMware-to-RBD, RBD-to-RBD, and qcow2-to-qcow2 baseline action suites pass;
10. VMware source `POWERED_OFF` permits Full Seed without an automatic power
    operation;
11. VMware source `POWERED_OFF` with a valid CBT baseline completes incremental
    transfer or `NO_CHANGE` without an automatic power operation;
12. VMware source migration between inventory read and VDDK open causes a
    bounded locator refresh, not Plan mutation or global capability failure;
13. no test persists observed placement as Plan routing authority.

Static regression checks must reject new code that reads a persisted host UUID
to decide action capability or dispatch without an explicit live resolver or
runtime lease.

## 10. AS-IS / TO-BE

| Layer | AS-IS | TO-BE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI | User selects internal workers | Platform schedules automatically; runtime placement is read-only |
| API | Plan accepts required worker IDs | Worker constraints optional and administrative only |
| Backend | One remote source lookup gates every action | Action-aware site capability and dynamic placement resolvers |
| Agent | Command route assumes a persisted worker UUID | Receives lease-bound commands for the selected runtime role |
| FTCTL | Worker identity can become Plan authority | Checkpoint identity survives worker replacement |
| DB | Transient host IDs stored with Plan configuration | Durable policy in Plan; placement and leases in runtime evidence |
| VMware source power | Incident observations can be mistaken for a `POWERED_ON` prerequisite | `POWERED_ON` and `POWERED_OFF` are valid capture states; no automatic power-on for readiness |
| VMware placement | Selected target worker and observed placement can become a fixed VDDK route | Refresh vCenter locator per attempt and lease an eligible VDDK worker automatically |

## 11. Implementation Map

The implementation uses one placement authority, `DrWorkerPlacementService`.
Callers must not implement their own `firstNonNull(plan.*WorkerHostId)` routing.

```java
Long resolveWorkerHostId(DrPlanVO plan, DrWorkerRole role);
Long resolveWorkerHostId(DrPlanVO plan, DrRunVO run, DrWorkerRole role);
```

The resolver applies these rules in order:

1. reuse the active Run lease when it names an eligible host;
2. determine the role's current site and zone;
3. enumerate `Up` KVM Agents in that zone;
4. filter VDDK workers by detected VDDK support when the provider requires it;
5. select deterministically from the currently eligible set so repeated phases
   of one Run remain stable without writing the host into the Plan;
6. on Agent loss, expire the lease and resolve again from refreshed inventory.

Admission stores `HOST:<id>:<operation-class>` only in `dr_resource_lease`.
The Plan's legacy worker columns and mapping JSON host keys are never consulted
for new routing and are never refreshed from VM placement. Existing values are
retained as historical data only.

The site-local `executeDrSiteAgentCommand` endpoint accepts no required worker
parameter. Its broker deserializes the allow-listed command first and chooses
an `Up` KVM Agent. For VM-local control it resolves the VM's current host at
dispatch time; for status/cancel it probes eligible hosts until the matching
Plan/Run evidence is found; for shared-storage and capability work it chooses
from all eligible workers. The response records the host actually used.

## 12. UI Implementation

The Plan create/edit dialog removes all three worker selectors and never sends
`sourceworkerhostid`, `targetworkerhostid`, or `coordinatorworkerhostid`.
Target compute sizing may use offering defaults and source VM properties but
must not depend on a selected host CPU speed. Preview and detail views show
`Automatic placement` and eligible/unavailable state. Actual execution hosts
belong only in read-only Run evidence.

No fixed-host validation message may block submit. Dark-mode colors use the
existing semantic text, border, success, warning, and error tokens; this change
does not introduce literal light backgrounds.

## 13. Mandatory Full Lifecycle Smoke Gate

Deployment is prohibited until all provider routes pass the same action
contract suite. A test may use mocks for provider I/O but must execute the real
Cloud action availability, command construction, FTCTL contract parsing, and
UI state helpers.

| Phase | Required assertions |
| --- | --- |
| Plan/readiness | stopped source accepted; no worker field required; automatic candidate present |
| Reprotect/failback preflight | stopped or unassigned serving VM accepted when target authority and durable checkpoint are valid |
| Full sync | accepted, durable terminal, Plan READY |
| Incremental sync | accepted or NO_CHANGE, durable terminal, RPO projection consistent |
| Pause/resume | terminal state and scheduler intent agree |
| Test Failover | durable checkpoint only; test artifact and boot gate reflected |
| Test Cleanup | source not required; test VM/artifacts and session terminal agree |
| Disaster Failover | source/site/VM power unavailable does not block target recovery |
| Planned Failover | live source host is observed only for the final local control step |
| Failback | committed authority, reverse baseline and terminal session agree |
| Reprotect | current authority becomes the new source without Plan host pinning |
| Release/delete | retain/delete disposition and resource cleanup remain distinct |

The matrix runs for VMware-to-RBD, RBD-to-RBD, and SharedMountPoint
qcow2-to-qcow2. Release tombstone, multi-disk checkpoint, terminal/Cycle
projection, group run, and action-capability regression suites are included.
Only after this gate, changed-module build, UI production build, and package
artifact checks pass may the same artifact set be deployed to the test sites.

## 14. Initial Plan Zone Resolution And Projection Contract

The Plan wizard already persists the selected target Zone in the normalized
mapping contract. Runtime worker placement must consume that value even when a
legacy or remotely registered `dr_site` row has no local `zone_id`. A missing
site-local foreign key must not turn a valid Plan into a fixed-host requirement.

The common worker placement service resolves the execution Zone in this order:

1. the selected site's local `zone_id`, when it is present and valid;
2. the normalized Plan mapping (`target.zoneId` / `targetZoneId`, or the source
   equivalent for a local source worker), resolved as a local numeric ID or UUID;
3. the only enabled local Zone, when the controller has exactly one Zone.

If none of these rules produces one unambiguous local Zone, placement returns a
typed no-eligible-worker result. It never persists a guessed worker or reuses a
VM's current host as Plan authority. This single resolution path applies to
readiness, action capability, admission, sync, pause/resume, Test Failover,
Test Cleanup, Failover, Failback, Reprotect, release, group actions, target
materialization, and runtime reconciliation.

A newly created Plan with no Run and no FTCTL runtime has no runtime state to
project. Projection must return a successful `INITIAL_SYNC_PENDING` observation
without dispatching an Agent status command. The protection view clears stale
refresh errors and presents this state as an informational initial-sync wait.
Once the first Run is accepted, normal FTCTL projection and all strict
checkpoint/terminal checks apply unchanged.

Regression requirements:

- a target site with `zone_id=NULL` and `target.zoneId` in the Plan selects an
  `Up` KVM worker from that Zone;
- a Zone UUID in the Plan resolves identically to its numeric ID;
- a single enabled local Zone is inferred only when neither site nor Plan names
  a Zone;
- multiple enabled Zones without an explicit mapping remain blocked;
- a pristine `NEW` Plan performs no Agent call and does not create a stale
  protection-view warning;
- after the first Run starts, missing placement remains a blocking error rather
  than being hidden by the initial-state rule;
- the complete action-contract matrix in this document remains green for
  VMware-to-RBD, RBD-to-RBD, and SharedMountPoint qcow2-to-qcow2.

## 15. Cross-Site Broker Contract And All-Menu Convergence

The site-local FTCTL API is the canonical cross-site execution endpoint. It
must follow the same transparent placement rule as the Plan Owner. Requiring
`workerhostuuid` at this boundary recreates a fixed-host dependency after the
Plan Owner has already selected a valid Zone and therefore blocks every menu
whose availability evaluates remote capabilities.

`executeFtctlDrSiteAgentCommand` now treats `workerhostuuid` as a deprecated,
ignored compatibility hint. The receiving site resolves current candidates on
each request from enabled Zones and `Up` KVM Agents. For source actions it may
prefer the source VM's current host discovered at execution time, but that
observation is not persisted as Plan authority. Capability, status, and cancel
may continue across candidates until an authoritative answer is found;
mutating actions and reverse preflight remain single-dispatch operations.

This is one shared availability gate for all affected menus:

| Menu or projection | Required convergence |
| --- | --- |
| Full resync and scheduled incremental sync | remote capability succeeds without a worker parameter |
| Pause, resume, and recovery sync | current source worker is resolved at request time |
| Test Failover and Test Cleanup | capability and checkpoint gates are evaluated independently of host history |
| Failover | disaster recovery remains executable without a reachable or fixed source host when policy permits |
| Failback and Reprotect | each active site resolves its current workers and preserves committed authority |
| Release and delete disposition | cleanup reaches the site-local worker without reusing a stale host binding |
| Group action and protection-view projection | member availability uses the same broker result and does not retain a stale capability error |

Both controller and worker-site Cloud packages must contain this contract.
Deployment is incomplete when the Plan Owner omits `workerhostuuid` but the
remote site API metadata still declares it required. Preflight therefore calls
the canonical API without the parameter and requires a typed capability answer
before UI action availability may be marked ready.

The compatibility endpoint `executeDrSiteAgentCommand` is a response-adapting
facade over `FtctlDrSiteAgentBrokerService`; it must contain no host DAO, Agent
dispatch, or command parsing logic. This single-owner constraint prevents the
two endpoint names from acquiring different fixed-worker contracts in a later
merge. A regression test verifies facade delegation, while the canonical
broker suite owns host discovery, current-VM preference, read-only evidence
search, mutation single-dispatch, and optional-parameter coverage.

Remote client code must not persist `sourceWorkerHostUuid` or reconstruct a
worker from historical Plan mapping. The source VM location may be observed by
the receiving site's broker for the duration of one request only. Dead helper
code that writes host UUIDs into `mapping_json` is prohibited because making it
callable later would silently restore fixed-host behavior.

## 16. Test Release Deployment And UI Verification

The final implementation was built from Cloud commit
`f6fe269538c3d8981457908f3bb64c36f6990783` by GitHub Actions run
`33710658000`. The release metadata and all four deployed RPM checksums matched
the published `SHA256SUMS`. The resulting package version is
`4.23.0.0-Mold.Europa.202609030315.1`.

The same `cloudstack-common`, `cloudstack-management`, `cloudstack-ui`, and
`cloudstack-usage` packages were installed on the 13 and 31 management sites.
Deployment preserved `/usr/share/cloudstack-management/webapp/WEB-INF`; the
active `/client/` endpoint returned HTTP 200, the service PID owned the 8080
listener, and all three KVM Agents returned to `Up` on both sites. Installed
bytecode was checked for both `INITIAL_SYNC_PENDING` and the dynamic site Agent
broker. This change contains no qemu/FTCTL host package modification.

The 31-site UI was then opened in a cache-disabled browser session and logged
in through the normal portal form. Plan
`79154e02-0089-411e-8fd9-660ff01b2cf4` rendered as:

- Plan state `NEW`, readiness `EXECUTION_READY`, and target readiness pending;
- an informational initial-sync message instead of
  `DR_TARGET_MAPPING_INVALID` or stale protection data;
- Full Resync enabled;
- Test Failover and Failover disabled until the first durable checkpoint;
- dark-mode action menu and protection view without untranslated or stale
  capability errors.

The Plan remained clean during verification: no Run, resource lease, error
code, or persisted source/target/coordinator worker existed. Both associated
`dr_site.zone_id` values remained `NULL`, proving that readiness came from the
Plan mapping and dynamic placement contract rather than manual DB repair. The
13- and 31-site management logs contained no new
`DR_TARGET_MAPPING_INVALID`, fixed-worker requirement, engine busy timeout, or
Cloud class-loading error after the UI refresh.

The next UI test action is Full Resync. Later actions must become available
only as their independent durability, authority, and lifecycle gates are
satisfied; this deployment deliberately did not manufacture those states or
invoke a destructive action during readiness verification.

## 17. SharedMountPoint Runtime Relocation And Stable VM Identity

Starting a previously stopped VM or live-migrating it must not invalidate a
durable SharedMountPoint checkpoint. The scheduler host is a renewable lease,
while the Cloud VM UUID and stable VM Details define source identity. A local
QMP miss followed by a qcow2 shared write-lock rejection means another host
currently owns the runtime; it is not an offline baseline failure.

FTCTL reports this condition as retryable
`DR_QCOW2_SOURCE_RUNTIME_UNAVAILABLE / WAITING_SOURCE` without modifying the
source image or bitmap. Cloud's recovery controller accepts that typed state,
queries current source placement, and dispatches `RECOVER_SYNC` through the
site broker. Pause and resume commands carry `sourceVmUuid` in their action
context as well, so the same dynamic preference applies to every scheduler
transition. No worker UUID is persisted as future execution authority.

Hardware fingerprint contract version 2 hashes only stable source identity:
VM UUID, firmware, Cloud `UEFI`, Secure Boot, guest type, CPU, memory, disk
controllers, and stable VM Details. Host UUID/name, instance name, runtime
messages, clone state, and other transient details are excluded. Projection
normalizes an existing Plan's hardware object before comparing a v2 runtime
fingerprint, preserving compatibility without rewriting Plan data.

The UI renders relocation as source recovery waiting rather than terminal
recovery failure. Acceptance requires the existing Plan to converge without a
DB edit from `WAITING_SOURCE_RECOVERY` to `READY`, retain its last durable
checkpoint, and complete the next Cycle as incremental or `NO_CHANGE`, never
as placement-triggered Full Seed. VMware-to-RBD and RBD-to-RBD run their normal
power-state and migration smoke suites as shared broker regression gates.

The worker-local canonical disk map is placement cache, not replication
authority. After live migration, Cloud supplies the current VM and storage
locator to the newly leased worker, and FTCTL reconstructs the canonical map
before choosing the Cycle transport. A missing local map cannot by itself
convert an incremental Cycle into Full Seed. With a valid durable bitmap epoch,
the first post-relocation Cycle is `CBT_INCREMENTAL` or `NO_CHANGE`; Full Seed
remains limited to an explicit Full Resync or proven baseline invalidation.

For stopped-source synchronization, the persistent bitmap embedded in the
qcow2 file is the durable baseline authority. The `baseline-*.bitmap` file in
a worker's `/run` directory is disposable cache. If it is absent after worker
relocation or restart, FTCTL validates the expected bitmap directly from qcow2
metadata and then atomically recreates only the cache marker. Cloud must not
project `DR_QCOW2_BASELINE_NOT_DURABLE` from a missing worker-local marker.

## Durable baseline handoff during source-host relocation

`RECOVER_SYNC` is a scheduler relocation operation, not a new protection
registration. The Plan Owner therefore resolves the current source VM placement and
adds its latest target-ready restore-point evidence to the action profile:
`checkpointSequence`, `checkpointRef`, `checkpointCycleToken`, source/target durable
timestamps, `resumeBaselineCheckpointSequence`, and the next required sequence.
The Agent forwards these fields unchanged. Engine checkpoint sequences are local
to the producer worker and are not an authority ordering domain. FTCTL always
projects the controller-accepted checkpoint reference, token, mode, and durable
timestamps into the new recovery Run and Plan status, even when a former worker's
cached sequence is numerically larger. The new worker keeps its own Plan Cycle
counter monotonic in a separate sequence file and still validates the embedded
qcow2 bitmap during the first incremental cycle. This keeps host migration
transparent while preserving the controlled Full Seed fallback for genuinely lost
baselines.

## Runtime authority discovery after source VM relocation

Remote Plan projection must carry the immutable source VM UUID on status and
cancel commands. The source site's broker resolves that UUID against its local
VM inventory for every request and prefers the VM's current host only for that
dispatch. It does not persist the observed host in the Plan, mapping, or runtime
authority.

A Plan-level status query may encounter historical runtime files on a former
host. A successful Agent response with Plan state `ERROR` and no live scheduler
is fallback evidence, not sufficient authority to stop discovery. The broker
continues across eligible workers and prefers a response with a live scheduler
or healthy active state. If no healthier response exists, it returns the error
fallback so a real terminal failure remains visible.

This rule applies to projection, recovery, pause/resume, cancellation, and all
menu capability refreshes. It prevents a stale host-local runtime from creating
false `SOURCE_HARDWARE_CHANGED` or `DR_QCOW2_OFFLINE_BASELINE_FAILED` errors
after start, stop, or live migration while preserving genuine failures.

Required regression cases are: status routes to the current VM host, stale
`ERROR` authority loses to a live `READY` scheduler, operation-scoped terminal
failure remains authoritative, stopped VM discovery can scan storage-capable
workers, and mutating actions are still dispatched exactly once.

## Remote action placement identity

Every remote source Action, including the post-promotion
`DR_CUTOVER_COMMIT_V2` acknowledgement, carries the immutable source VM UUID in
its command context. The receiving Site Agent broker resolves that UUID against
current local inventory immediately before its single dispatch. This keeps a
failover Run and its authority commit on the same current source host after live
migration without persisting a host UUID in the Plan or treating placement as
authority. Commands that already contain a profile must use the same context;
profile-less continuation commands must not fall back to the first host in
numeric order merely because their payload omits source identity.

The regression contract covers a live-migrated source whose failover-final
checkpoint is produced on the new host, followed by a profile-less cutover
commit. The broker must prefer the VM's current host, dispatch the mutating
command exactly once, and never write the observed host UUID back to Plan data.

## Cross-host authority ordering

`scheduler_lease_epoch` is local to one FTCTL worker and is not comparable after
the source VM or storage-capable worker moves to another host. For remote KVM
source protection, Cloud orders Plan-authority observations by the
Cloud-floored `authority_sequence` first and uses `scheduler_lease_epoch` only
when the authority sequence is equal. A healthy current-host response with a
higher authority sequence replaces an older failed projection even when its
local lease epoch is lower. Conversely, a stale worker cannot replace the
current projection merely by reporting a larger host-local lease epoch.

This ordering applies only to read-only Plan-authority projection. Operation
status remains correlated by Plan and Run UUID, and mutating commands remain
single-dispatch. Engine cycle numbers may restart on a relocated worker; Cloud
assigns a monotonic canonical `dr_sync_cycle.sequence` while retaining the
engine cycle token and authority sequence as provenance.

The same canonical completed sequence is written to
`dr_plan_runtime.latest_completed_cycle_sequence` and the retained transfer
summary before the Runtime row is persisted. Protection-view summary and
completed-cycle detail must therefore display one sequence even when the
relocated engine restarts its host-local cycle counter.

The protection view labels the Cloud canonical value as the completed
replication cycle. A worker-local checkpoint sequence remains visible only as
engine checkpoint provenance under the durable recovery checkpoint section;
it is not presented as another replication-cycle sequence.

## 18. Authority-ranked Status And Legacy Fingerprint Convergence

The current VM host is a dispatch preference, not read authority. A Plan-level
STATUS request queries every eligible site worker and ranks meaningful answers
by requested Run correlation, monotonic authority sequence, runtime generation,
latest completed canonical sequence, scheduler liveness, and health. Current
placement is only the final tie-break because its candidate is queried first.
ACTION and reverse-preflight commands remain single-dispatch and continue to
resolve current placement immediately before execution.

Existing Plans and FTCTL profiles may contain the host-bound, unversioned
hardware fingerprint. FTCTL status derives fingerprint contract v2 from the
profile hardware without modifying the profile or Plan. Cloud accepts either
the exact persisted fingerprint or the stable fingerprint calculated from the
same hardware object. A mismatch after both checks remains
`SOURCE_HARDWARE_CHANGED`; migration alone can no longer produce that error.

While relocation recovery is pending, the protection UI displays
`WAITING_SOURCE`, the latest durable completed Cycle, and that Cycle's NBD
teardown evidence. A stale former-worker Run must not appear as active transfer
or overwrite durable `DRAINED` evidence. Acceptance requires the affected Plan
to recover without a DB update, retain Cycle 803, and publish the next Cycle as
`CBT_INCREMENTAL` or `NO_CHANGE` rather than Full Seed.

The FTCTL release gate reproduces a relocated worker with a stale local completion
whose numeric checkpoint sequence is larger than the controller-selected durable
checkpoint. It passes only when the accepted provenance replaces the stale status,
the local allocation counter remains monotonic, and the first recovered Cycle is
classified as incremental. This prevents a later placement change from silently
transferring the full virtual disk.

## 19. Serialized Recovery State Presentation

Protection-view payloads can expose the same runtime evidence through
`runtimeErrorCode`, `errorCode`, `schedulerHealth`, or
`schedulerHealthState`, depending on whether the value came from the Plan or
the cached runtime projection. The UI normalizes these aliases before deriving
state. `DR_QCOW2_SOURCE_RUNTIME_UNAVAILABLE`, `DR_SOURCE_SITE_UNAVAILABLE`, or
`WAITING_SOURCE` therefore always renders as `WAITING_SOURCE_RECOVERY`.

During that state, a superseded Plan-level `SOURCE_HARDWARE_CHANGED` message
must not replace the current retryable relocation diagnosis. The current
failed Cycle and its NBD error are not active evidence; transfer bytes,
effective mode, and NBD teardown come from the latest durable completed Cycle.
After recovery succeeds, normal Plan and runtime errors are shown again under
their ordinary precedence rules.

## 20. Planned Failover Power Observation Contract

For a planned SharedMountPoint qcow2 Failover, Cloud reads the source VM power
state from the source Mold immediately before building the action command. A
running source uses the existing `QMP_STOP` contract. An already stopped source
uses `SOURCE_ALREADY_STOPPED` and carries
`sourceRuntimeObservedPowerState=POWERED_OFF` in both request JSON and profile
JSON. A missing domain, stale host, or failed QMP lookup is never converted into
an offline observation.

The FTCTL Run is cutover-ready when its Run-owned frozen disk map is valid and
either `PAUSED/QMP_STOP` or `OFFLINE/SOURCE_ALREADY_STOPPED` is present. For the
offline case, FTCTL additionally validates every qcow2 persistent bitmap in the
disk set before publishing the evidence. Cloud rechecks the source Mold state
before target promotion and requires `POWERED_OFF`; this closes the observation
race without adding a durable worker or VM-host binding.

This is a changed-module deployment contract. The disaster-recovery plugin and
the FTCTL runtime script are built and tested from WSL ext4, then deployed in
the same shape to both source and target test clusters. A full Cloud or FTCTL
release build is not required unless explicitly requested. Existing running-VM
planned Failover, disaster Failover, VMware-to-RBD, and RBD-to-RBD behavior must
pass their current regression gates unchanged.

## 21. In-flight Runtime Owner Discovery

DR Plans never persist a VM host, coordinator, source worker, or target worker as
execution authority. New operations continue to use live VM placement and
storage-capable worker admission. Continuation operations are different: a
`CUTOVER_COMMIT`, `FAILBACK_COMMIT`, matching status operation, or abort must be
delivered to the worker that owns the already-created Run runtime.

Before one of those mutations, the source-site broker sends a read-only
`OPERATION` status query for the immutable `planUuid + runUuid` to every eligible
worker. An exact Run UUID match selects the authoritative runtime owner. The
mutation is then sent once to that worker and is never retried on another worker.
If no owner exists yet, the broker retains the ordinary live-placement fallback;
it must not manufacture or persist a worker binding.

This rule covers a stopped VM whose Cloud `host_id` is null and a VM that moved
after the Run began. Regression tests require a stopped VM, a runtime on a
non-first candidate, exact owner discovery, and proof that the mutation was sent
only to the owner. Existing new-run scheduling behavior remains unchanged.

## 22. Relocation Recovery Lock Boundary

When a SharedMountPoint source VM moves, the former worker may report
`DR_QCOW2_SOURCE_RUNTIME_UNAVAILABLE`. Cloud resolves the VM's current host and
dispatches `RECOVER_SYNC` there so the Plan profile and scheduler can be
re-established without changing the durable checkpoint or forcing Full Seed.

`RECOVER_SYNC` is a Plan-scoped scheduler-control operation. It has the same
locking contract as Sync, Pause, and Resume and must not contend on the legacy
host-global FT/HA lock. An unrelated Plan scheduler running on the selected
host must not turn relocation into `DR_ENGINE_BUSY_TIMEOUT`. The recovery Run
may retry a transient Plan lock, but success requires the first post-relocation
Cycle to complete as `CBT_INCREMENTAL` or `NO_CHANGE` and clear the temporary
`WAITING_SOURCE_RECOVERY` UI state without direct DB repair.

The operation projector applies its runtime-creation grace period to the
already resolved and correlated `RECOVER_SYNC` Run. It must not re-query the
active Run before deciding whether `run_not_found` is terminal. That repeated
DAO read creates a race with dispatch and concurrent projection: a valid Run
can be temporarily absent even though the relocated scheduler creates its Run
state a few seconds later. During the grace period the UI keeps the operation
in `DR_RUNTIME_STARTING`; only the same resolved Run may become
`DR_RUNTIME_NOT_CREATED` after the grace expires.

## 23. Plan-Owned Export Set Atomicity

Failback transport preparation is successful only when the source-site Agent
returns one unique NBD export for every disk in the Plan mapping. Cloud compares
the returned device set with the complete mapping before injecting exports into
the reverse profile. A missing, blank, duplicate, or extra device rejects the
transport contract before reverse transfer starts; a partial set must never be
treated as an accepted Failback data plane.

The target-site FTCTL owns atomic publication and per-Plan serialization of the
export set. Cloud does not reconstruct a partial answer from persisted state and
does not silently retry a transfer with fewer disks. This preserves the
successful single-disk path while making N-disk Failback independent of a timer
reconciliation race. Tests cover incomplete two-disk responses in Cloud and a
concurrent Agent-start/reconciler transition in FTCTL.
