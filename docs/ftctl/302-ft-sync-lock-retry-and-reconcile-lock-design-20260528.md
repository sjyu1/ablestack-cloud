# FT sync lock retry and reconcile lock scope design

## Background

FT protection registration can legitimately overlap with the qemu FTCTL periodic `reconcile` timer. In one FT validation run, Cloud had already created the standby VM and volumes, but the registration job failed during cluster/profile sync because qemu returned a retryable lock:

```text
{"command":"config","result":"locked","lock_file":"/run/ablestack-vm-ftctl/lock","holder_command":"reconcile","exit_code":20,"retryable":true}
```

This was not a VM provisioning failure and did not reach the X-COLO transfer path.

## Cloud Behavior

Cloud already retries retryable lock responses for FTCTL runtime actions. The same rule applies to FTCTL sync commands because cluster/profile sync is part of the protection transaction:

- retry `FtctlSyncAnswer` when the answer reports exit code `20`;
- retry when `ftctlResult` is `locked`;
- retry when details or output contains `"result":"locked"`;
- use the existing FTCTL lock retry interval and timeout;
- fail immediately for non-lock sync failures.

## qemu Behavior

qemu FTCTL must reduce timer contention:

- `reconcile` does not take a global command lock;
- reconcile uses VM-specific locks only;
- `reconcile --vm` and timer-driven reconcile use the same VM lock model;
- a reconcile lock miss is recorded as a skipped reconcile cycle, not as a fatal error.

## Ownership Boundaries

- Cloud remains responsible for cloud-managed VM and volume creation.
- qemu FTCTL remains responsible for X-COLO runtime state and replication.
- Cloud sync retry does not duplicate qemu state handling; it only handles transient command admission while qemu is busy.

## Compatibility

This design is shared by FT and the existing HA/DR cloud-managed model. It does not change action semantics, VM lifecycle ownership, or the Mold Agent/qemu command boundary.
