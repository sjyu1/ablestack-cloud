# Introduction

This is used to build appliances for use with ABLESTACK. Currently two
build profiles are available for building systemvmtemplate (Debian based) and
CentOS based built-in user VM template.

# Setting up Tools and Environment

- Install packer (v1.8.x, v1.9.x tested) and latest KVM, qemu on a Linux x86
  machine (Ubuntu 20.04 tested)
- Install `qemu-img`, the other KVM/QEMU tools used by `build.sh`, and
  `sharutils` for packaging the System VM scripts.
- Build and install `vhd-util` as described in build.sh or use pre-built
  binaries at:

      http://packages.shapeblue.com/systemvmtemplate/vhd-util
      http://packages.shapeblue.com/systemvmtemplate/libvhd.so.1.0

- For building ARM64 systemvm template on amd64 systems, please also install:
  qemu-utils qemu-system-arm qemu-efi-aarch64

# How to build appliances

The active System VM release path exports only a compressed KVM QCOW2 image in
the `dist` directory. VMware OVA/VMDK, XenServer, OVM, and Hyper-V exports are
not part of the ABLESTACK release build.

Run `build.sh` with the template name, version, architecture, and optional build
number:

    bash build.sh <name> <version> <arch> [build-number]
    bash build.sh systemvmtemplate 4.22.0.0 x86_64 123

For building builtin x86_64 template run:

    bash build.sh builtin
